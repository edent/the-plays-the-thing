  <h1>Readable Shakespeare Plays</h1>
  <p class="caution"><span class="warning">WARNING:</span> This is an unfinished work in progress made by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/beng">@beng</a> and forked by @edent.
  Enter at your own risk.
  Nothing too serious, but some of the plays are incomplete and some need a bit of tidying up.
  If you'd like to help, get in touch or have a peek at the <a href="https://github.com/techbelly/the-plays-the-thing">github project</a>.
