There had she not been long, but she became

A joyful mother of two goodly sons;

As could not be distinguish'd but by names.

That very hour, and in the self-same inn,

A meaner woman was delivered

Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:

Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
<a class="line" href="#line-56">❦</a>

I bought and brought up to attend my sons.

My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
<a class="line" href="#line-58">❦</a>

<span class="line" id="line-59">
Made daily motions for our home return:
<a class="line" href="#line-59">❦</a>

<span class="line" id="line-60">
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
<a class="line" href="#line-60">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-61">
We came aboard.
<a class="line" href="#line-61">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-62">
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
<a class="line" href="#line-62">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-63">
Before the always wind-obeying deep
<a class="line" href="#line-63">❦</a>

<span class="line" id="line-64">
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
<a class="line" href="#line-64">❦</a>

<span class="line" id="line-65">
But longer did we not retain much hope;
<a class="line" href="#line-65">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-66">
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
<a class="line" href="#line-66">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-67">
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
<a class="line" href="#line-67">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-68">
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
<a class="line" href="#line-68">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-69">
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
<a class="line" href="#line-69">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-70">
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
<a class="line" href="#line-70">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-71">
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
<a class="line" href="#line-71">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-72">
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
<a class="line" href="#line-72">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-73">
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
<a class="line" href="#line-73">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-74">
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
<a class="line" href="#line-74">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-75">
And this it was, for other means was none:
<a class="line" href="#line-75">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-76">
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
<a class="line" href="#line-76">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-77">
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
<a class="line" href="#line-77">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-78">
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
<a class="line" href="#line-78">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-79">
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
<a class="line" href="#line-79">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-80">
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
<a class="line" href="#line-80">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-81">
To him one of the other twins was bound,
<a class="line" href="#line-81">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-82">
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
<a class="line" href="#line-82">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-83">
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
<a class="line" href="#line-83">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-84">
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
<a class="line" href="#line-84">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-85">
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
<a class="line" href="#line-85">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-86">
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
<a class="line" href="#line-86">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-87">
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
<a class="line" href="#line-87">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-88">
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
<a class="line" href="#line-88">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-89">
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
<a class="line" href="#line-89">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-90">
And by the benefit of his wished light,
<a class="line" href="#line-90">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-91">
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
<a class="line" href="#line-91">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-92">
Two ships from far making amain to us,
<a class="line" href="#line-92">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-93">
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
<a class="line" href="#line-93">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-94">
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
<a class="line" href="#line-94">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-95">
Gather the sequel by that went before.
<a class="line" href="#line-95">❦</a>

Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;

O, had the gods done so, I had not now
<a class="line" href="#line-98">❦</a>

Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
<a class="line" href="#line-99">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-100">
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
<a class="line" href="#line-100">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-101">
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
<a class="line" href="#line-101">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-102">
Which being violently borne upon,
<a class="line" href="#line-102">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-103">
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
<a class="line" href="#line-103">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-104">
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
<a class="line" href="#line-104">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-105">
Fortune had left to both of us alike
<a class="line" href="#line-105">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-106">
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
<a class="line" href="#line-106">❦</a>

<span class="line" id="line-107">
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
<a class="line" href="#line-107">❦</a>

With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
<a class="line" href="#line-108">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-109">
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
<a class="line" href="#line-109">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-110">
And in our sight they three were taken up
<a class="line" href="#line-110">❦</a>

<span class="line" id="line-111">
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
<a class="line" href="#line-111">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-112">
At length, another ship had seized on us;
<a class="line" href="#line-112">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-113">
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
<a class="line" href="#line-113">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-114">
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
<a class="line" href="#line-114">❦</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="line-115">
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,

Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
<a class="line" href="#line-116">❦</a>

And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
<a class="line" href="#line-117">❦</a>

Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
