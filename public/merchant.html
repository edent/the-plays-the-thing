<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
I am to learn;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
That I have much ado to know myself.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SALARINO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
As they fly by them with their woven wings.

<b class="speaker">SALANIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
The better part of my affections would
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
And every object that might make me fear
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
Would make me sad.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SALARINO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
My wind cooling my broth
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
And see the holy edifice of stone,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
Upon the fortune of this present year:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
Why, then you are in love.
</span>
</p>

Fie, fie!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SALARINO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
And other of such vinegar aspect
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,

Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:

We leave you now with better company.

<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,

If worthier friends had not prevented me.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
I take it, your own business calls on you
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-79">
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
Good morrow, my good lords.
</span>
</p>

<span class="line" id="0-0-83">
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SALARINO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

<b class="speaker">LORENZO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-89">
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

I will not fail you.

<b class="speaker">GRATIANO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
You look not well, Signior Antonio;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
You have too much respect upon the world:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-98">
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-100">
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
A stage where every man must play a part,
</span>

And mine a sad one.

Let me play the fool:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-105">
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-106">
And let my liver rather heat with wine
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-107">
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-109">
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-110">
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-111">
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-112">
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-113">
There are a sort of men whose visages
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-114">
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-115">
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-116">
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-117">
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-118">
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,

<span class="line" id="0-0-119">
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'

O my Antonio, I do know of these

That therefore only are reputed wise
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-122">
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-123">
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,

<span class="line" id="0-0-124">
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.

<span class="line" id="0-0-125">
I'll tell thee more of this another time:

<span class="line" id="0-0-126">
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-127">
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-128">
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-129">
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

<p>
<b class="speaker">LORENZO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-131">
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-132">
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
</span>

For Gratiano never lets me speak.

Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-140">140</a>

Is that any thing now?

<p>
<b class="speaker">BASSANIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more

than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two

<span class="line" id="0-0-148">
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you

<span class="line" id="0-0-149">
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you

have them, they are not worth the search.

<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-152">
Well, tell me now what lady is the same

To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,

That you to-day promised to tell me of?

'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-157">
How much I have disabled mine estate,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-158">
By something showing a more swelling port
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-159">
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-160">
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-160">160</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-161">
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-162">
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-163">
Wherein my time something too prodigal
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-164">
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-165">
I owe the most, in money and in love,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-166">
And from your love I have a warranty
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-167">
To unburden all my plots and purposes

How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;

And if it stand, as you yourself still do,

My purse, my person, my extremest means,

<span class="line" id="0-0-176">
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-177">
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-178">
The self-same way with more advised watch,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-179">
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both

<span class="line" id="0-0-180">
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,

Because what follows is pure innocence.

<span class="line" id="0-0-182">
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,

That which I owe is lost; but if you please

To shoot another arrow that self way

Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,

As I will watch the aim, or to find both
</span>

Or bring your latter hazard back again

And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

In making question of my uttermost

Than if you had made waste of all I have:

Then do but say to me what I should do

When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--

This Jacob from our holy Abram was,

Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.

When Laban and himself were compromised

That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied

The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,

He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,

Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
