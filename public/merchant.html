In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
<a class="line" href="#line-1">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-2">
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
<a class="line" href="#line-2">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-3">
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
<a class="line" href="#line-3">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-4">
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
<a class="line" href="#line-4">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-5">
I am to learn;
<a class="line" href="#line-5">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-6">
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
<a class="line" href="#line-6">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-7">
That I have much ado to know myself.
<a class="line" href="#line-7">❦</a></span>

<b class="speaker">SALARINO</b>
<span class="line" id="line-8">
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
<a class="line" href="#line-8">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-9">
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
<a class="line" href="#line-9">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-10">
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
<a class="line" href="#line-10">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-11">
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
<a class="line" href="#line-11">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-12">
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
<a class="line" href="#line-12">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-13">
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
<a class="line" href="#line-13">❦</a></span>

As they fly by them with their woven wings.

<span class="line" id="line-15">
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
<a class="line" href="#line-15">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-16">
The better part of my affections would
<a class="line" href="#line-16">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-17">
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
<a class="line" href="#line-17">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-18">
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
<a class="line" href="#line-18">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-19">
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
<a class="line" href="#line-19">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-20">
And every object that might make me fear
<a class="line" href="#line-20">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-21">
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
<a class="line" href="#line-21">❦</a></span>

Would make me sad.

<span class="line" id="line-23">
My wind cooling my broth
<a class="line" href="#line-23">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-24">
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
<a class="line" href="#line-24">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-25">
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
<a class="line" href="#line-25">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-26">
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
<a class="line" href="#line-26">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-27">
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
<a class="line" href="#line-27">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-28">
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
<a class="line" href="#line-28">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-29">
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
<a class="line" href="#line-29">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-30">
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
<a class="line" href="#line-30">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-31">
And see the holy edifice of stone,
<a class="line" href="#line-31">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-32">
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
<a class="line" href="#line-32">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-33">
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
<a class="line" href="#line-33">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-34">
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
<a class="line" href="#line-34">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-35">
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
<a class="line" href="#line-35">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-36">
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
<a class="line" href="#line-36">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-37">
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
<a class="line" href="#line-37">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-38">
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
<a class="line" href="#line-38">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-39">
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
<a class="line" href="#line-39">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-40">
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
<a class="line" href="#line-40">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-41">
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

<span class="line" id="line-42">
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,

My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
<a class="line" href="#line-43">❦</a></span>

Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate

Upon the fortune of this present year:

Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,

<span class="line" id="line-50">
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
<a class="line" href="#line-50">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-51">
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
<a class="line" href="#line-51">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-52">
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
<a class="line" href="#line-52">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-53">
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
<a class="line" href="#line-53">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-54">
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
<a class="line" href="#line-54">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-55">
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
<a class="line" href="#line-55">❦</a></span>

And other of such vinegar aspect

You have too much respect upon the world:

Let me play the fool:

<span class="line" id="line-83">
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,

And let my liver rather heat with wine

Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?

Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice

I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--

There are a sort of men whose visages

<span class="line" id="line-92">
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,

Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,

If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,

I'll tell thee more of this another time:
