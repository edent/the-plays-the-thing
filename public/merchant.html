                     In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I am to learn;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That I have much ado to know myself.

                     Your mind is tossing on the ocean;

                     There, where your argosies with portly sail,

                     Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,

                     Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,

                     Do overpeer the petty traffickers,

                     As they fly by them with their woven wings.

                     Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
                  
                <br />

                     Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And every object that might make me fear
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt

                     Would make me sad.

                     My wind cooling my broth

                     Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But I should think of shallows and of flats,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And see the holy edifice of stone,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,

                     Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,

                     And, in a word, but even now worth this,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
                  
                <br />

                     Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

                     In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The self-same way with more advised watch,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Because what follows is pure innocence.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That which I owe is lost; but if you please
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To shoot another arrow that self way
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As I will watch the aim, or to find both
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or bring your latter hazard back again
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

                     You know me well, and herein spend but time

                     To wind about my love with circumstance;

                     And out of doubt you do me now more wrong

                     Then do but say to me what I should do

                     And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

                     In Belmont is a lady richly left;

                     And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes

                     I did receive fair speechless messages:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:

                     For the four winds blow in from every coast

                     Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
                  
                <br />

                     And many Jasons come in quest of her.

                     This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:

                     I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.

                     Had been the very sum of my confession:

                     Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:

                     I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.

                     O sweet Portia,

                     Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words

                     That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,

                     When I did first impart my love to you,

                     Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;

                     And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,

                     How much I was a braggart. When I told you

                     Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Why he, a harmless necessary cat;

                     Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Must yield to such inevitable shame
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As to offend, himself being offended;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
                  
                <br />

                     A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That, in the course of justice, none of us
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much

                     And bring your music forth into the air.

                     How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!

                     Here will we sit and let the sounds of music

                     Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night

                     Become the touches of sweet harmony.

                     Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven

                     But in his motion like an angel sings,

                     Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Such harmony is in immortal souls;

                     But whilst this muddy vesture of decay

                     Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

                     Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

                     A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,

                     To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:

                     A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger

                     I gave my love a ring and made him swear

                     Never to part with it; and here he stands;

                     I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it

                     Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth

                     That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,

                     What ring gave you my lord?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

                     If I could add a lie unto a fault,

                     I would deny it; but you see my finger

                     Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

                     Sweet Portia,

                     If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If you did know for whom I gave the ring
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And would conceive for what I gave the ring
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And how unwillingly I left the ring,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When nought would be accepted but the ring,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

                     If you had known the virtue of the ring,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or your own honour to contain the ring,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     You would not then have parted with the ring.

                     What man is there so much unreasonable,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If you had pleased to have defended it

                     With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To urge the thing held as a ceremony?

                     I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

                     No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,

                     No woman had it, but a civil doctor,

                     And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
                  
                <br />

                     Even he that did uphold the very life

                     I was enforced to send it after him;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I was beset with shame and courtesy;
