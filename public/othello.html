          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly                <br />
                     That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse                <br />
                     As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     'Sblood, but you will not hear me:                <br />
                     If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,                <br />
                     In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,                <br />
                     Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,                <br />
                     I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:                <br />
                     But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,                <br />
                     Evades them, with a bombast circumstance                <br />
                     Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;                <br />
                     And, in conclusion,                <br />
                     Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,                <br />
                     'I have already chose my officer.'                <br />
                     And what was he?                <br />
                     Forsooth, a great arithmetician,                <br />
                     One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,                <br />
                     A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;                <br />
                     That never set a squadron in the field,                <br />
                     Nor the division of a battle knows                <br />
                     More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,                <br />
                     Wherein the toged consuls can propose                <br />
                     As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,                <br />
                     Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:                <br />
                     And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof                <br />
                     At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds                <br />
                     Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd                <br />
                     By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,                <br />
                     He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,                <br />
                     And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,                <br />
                     Preferment goes by letter and affection,                <br />
                     And not by old gradation, where each second                <br />
                     Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,                <br />
                     Whether I in any just term am affined                <br />
                     To love the Moor.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     I would not follow him then.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     O, sir, content you;                <br />
                     I follow him to serve my turn upon him:                <br />
                     We cannot all be masters, nor all masters                <br />
                     Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark                <br />
                     Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,                <br />
                     That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,                <br />
                     Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,                <br />
                     For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:                <br />
                     Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are                <br />
                     Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,                <br />
                     Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,                <br />
                     And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,                <br />
                     Do well thrive by them and when they have lined                <br />
                     their coats                <br />
                     Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;                <br />
                     And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,                <br />
                     It is as sure as you are Roderigo,                <br />
                     Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:                <br />
                     In following him, I follow but myself;                <br />
                     Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,                <br />
                     But seeming so, for my peculiar end:                <br />
                     For when my outward action doth demonstrate                <br />
                     The native act and figure of my heart                <br />
                     In compliment extern, 'tis not long after                <br />
                     But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve                <br />
                     For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     What a full fortune does the thicklips owe                <br />
                     If he can carry't thus!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Call up her father,                <br />
                     Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,                <br />
                     Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,                <br />
                     And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,                <br />
                     Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,                <br />
                     Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,                <br />
                     As it may lose some colour.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell                <br />
                     As when, by night and negligence, the fire                <br />
                     Is spied in populous cities.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>

          <p>

                     Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!                <br />
                     Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!                <br />
                     Thieves! thieves!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">BRABANTIO</b>
                     What is the reason of this terrible summons?                <br />
                     What is the matter there?                <br />

                     your gown;                <br />
                     Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;                <br />
                     Even now, now, very now, an old black ram                <br />

                     Being full of supper and distempering draughts,                <br />
                     Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come                <br />
                     To start my quiet.                <br />

                     To make this bitter to thee.                <br />

                     Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,                <br />
                     If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,                <br />
                     As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,                <br />
                     At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,                <br />
                     Transported, with no worse nor better guard                <br />
                     But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,                <br />
                     To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--                <br />
                     If this be known to you and your allowance,                <br />
                     We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;                <br />
                     But if you know not this, my manners tell me                <br />
                     We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe                <br />
                     That, from the sense of all civility,                <br />
                     I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:                <br />
                     Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,                <br />
                     I say again, hath made a gross revolt;                <br />
                     Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes                <br />
                     In an extravagant and wheeling stranger                <br />
                     Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:                <br />
                     If she be in her chamber or your house,                <br />
                     Let loose on me the justice of the state                <br />
                     For thus deluding you.                <br />

                     With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,                <br />

                     Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.                <br />
                     Yet, for necessity of present life,                <br />
                     I must show out a flag and sign of love,                <br />
                     Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,                <br />
                     Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;                <br />
                     And there will I be with him. So, farewell.                <br />

                     How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me                <br />

                     Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;                <br />

                     That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,                <br />

                     That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,                <br />
                     So may he with more facile question bear it,                <br />

                     That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,                <br />
                     We must not think the Turk is so unskilful                <br />

                     Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,                <br />
                     My very noble and approved good masters,                <br />
                     That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,                <br />
                     It is most true; true, I have married her:                <br />
                     The very head and front of my offending                <br />
                     Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,                <br />
                     And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:                <br />
                     For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,                <br />
                     Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used                <br />
                     Their dearest action in the tented field,                <br />
                     And little of this great world can I speak,                <br />
                     More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,                <br />
                     And therefore little shall I grace my cause                <br />
                     In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,                <br />
                     I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver                <br />
                     Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,                <br />
                     What conjuration and what mighty magic,                <br />
                     For such proceeding I am charged withal,                <br />

                     Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion                <br />
                     Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,                <br />

                     It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect                <br />

                     Against all rules of nature, and must be driven                <br />

                     That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,                <br />

                     To vouch this, is no proof,                <br />
                     Without more wider and more overt test                <br />

                     Her father loved me; oft invited me;                <br />
                     Still question'd me the story of my life,                <br />
                     From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,                <br />
                     That I have passed.                <br />
                     I ran it through, even from my boyish days,                <br />
                     To the very moment that he bade me tell it;                <br />
                     Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,                <br />
                     Of moving accidents by flood and field                <br />
                     Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,                <br />
                     Of being taken by the insolent foe                <br />
                     And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence                <br />
                     And portance in my travels' history:                <br />
                     Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,                <br />
                     Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven                <br />
                     It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;                <br />
                     And of the Cannibals that each other eat,                <br />

                     Would Desdemona seriously incline:                <br />
                     But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:                <br />
                     Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,                <br />
                     She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear                <br />
                     Devour up my discourse: which I observing,                <br />
                     Took once a pliant hour, and found good means                <br />
                     To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart                <br />
                     That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,                <br />
                     Whereof by parcels she had something heard,                <br />
                     But not intentively: I did consent,                <br />
                     And often did beguile her of her tears,                <br />
                     When I did speak of some distressful stroke                <br />
                     That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,                <br />
                     She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:                <br />
                     She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,                <br />
                     'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:                <br />
                     She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd                <br />
                     That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,                <br />
                     And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,                <br />
                     I should but teach him how to tell my story.                <br />
                     And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:                <br />
                     She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,                <br />
                     And I loved her that she did pity them.                <br />
                     This only is the witchcraft I have used:                <br />

                     I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,                <br />
                     And so much duty as my mother show'd                <br />
                     To you, preferring you before her father,                <br />
                     So much I challenge that I may profess                <br />
                     Due to the Moor my lord.                <br />

                     I had rather to adopt a child than get it.                <br />
                     Come hither, Moor:                <br />
                     I here do give thee that with all my heart                <br />
                     Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart                <br />
                     I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,                <br />
                     I am glad at soul I have no other child:                <br />
                     For thy escape would teach me tyranny,                <br />
                     To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.                <br />

                     Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,                <br />
                     Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers                <br />
                     Into your favour.                <br />
                     When remedies are past, the griefs are ended                <br />
                     By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.                <br />
                     To mourn a mischief that is past and gone                <br />
                     Is the next way to draw new mischief on.                <br />
                     What cannot be preserved when fortune takes                <br />
                     Patience her injury a mockery makes.                <br />
                     The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;                <br />
                     He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.                <br />

                     So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;                <br />
                     We lose it not, so long as we can smile.                <br />
                     He bears the sentence well that nothing bears                <br />
                     But the free comfort which from thence he hears,                <br />
                     But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow                <br />
                     That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.                <br />
                     These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,                <br />
                     Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:                <br />
                     But words are words; I never yet did hear                <br />
                     That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.                <br />

                     O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four                <br />
                     times seven years; and since I could distinguish                <br />
                     betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man                <br />
                     that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I                <br />
                     would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I                <br />
                     would change my humanity with a baboon.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so                <br />
                     fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.                <br />

          <p>

                     Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus                <br />
                     or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which                <br />
                     our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant                <br />
                     nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up                <br />
                     thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or                <br />
                     distract it with many, either to have it sterile                <br />
                     with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the                <br />
                     power and corrigible authority of this lies in our                <br />
                     wills. If the balance of our lives had not one                <br />
                     scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the                <br />
                     blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us                <br />
                     to most preposterous conclusions: but we have                <br />
                     reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal                <br />
                     stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that                <br />
                     you call love to be a sect or scion.                <br />

                     It cannot be.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of                <br />
                     the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown                <br />
                     cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy                <br />
                     friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with                <br />
                     cables of perdurable toughness; I could never                <br />
                     better stead thee than now. Put money in thy                <br />
                     purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with                <br />
                     an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It                <br />
                     cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her                <br />
                     love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he                <br />
                     his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou                <br />
                     shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but                <br />
                     money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in                <br />
                     their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food                <br />
                     that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be                <br />
                     to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must                <br />
                     change for youth: when she is sated with his body,                <br />
                     she will find the error of her choice: she must                <br />
                     have change, she must: therefore put money in thy                <br />
                     purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a                <br />
                     more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money                <br />
                     thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt                <br />
                     an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not                <br />
                     too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou                <br />
                     shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of                <br />
                     drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek                <br />
                     thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than                <br />
                     to be drowned and go without her.                <br />

                     Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on                <br />

                     thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I                <br />
                     hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no                <br />
                     less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge                <br />
                     against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost                <br />
                     thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many                <br />
                     events in the womb of time which will be delivered.                <br />
                     Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more                <br />

                     For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,                <br />
                     If I would time expend with such a snipe.                <br />
                     But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:                <br />
                     And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets                <br />
                     He has done my office: I know not if't be true;                <br />
                     But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,                <br />
                     Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;                <br />
                     The better shall my purpose work on him.                <br />
                     Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:                <br />
                     To get his place and to plume up my will                <br />
                     In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--                <br />
                     After some time, to abuse Othello's ear                <br />
                     That he is too familiar with his wife.                <br />
                     He hath a person and a smooth dispose                <br />
                     To be suspected, framed to make women false.                <br />
                     The Moor is of a free and open nature,                <br />
                     That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,                <br />
                     And will as tenderly be led by the nose                <br />
                     As asses are.                <br />
                     I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night                <br />

                     devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of                <br />
                     sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to                <br />
                     give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,                <br />
                     sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which                <br />
                     the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these                <br />
                     required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will                <br />
                     find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,                <br />
                     disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will                <br />
                     instruct her in it and compel her to some second                <br />
                     choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most                <br />

                     conscionable than in putting on the mere form of                <br />
                     civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing                <br />
                     of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,                <br />
                     none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a                <br />
                     finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and                <br />
                     counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never                <br />
                     present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the                <br />

                     for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows                <br />
                     you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find                <br />
                     some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking                <br />
                     too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what                <br />
                     other course you please, which the time shall more                <br />

                     Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply                <br />
                     may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for                <br />
                     even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to                <br />
                     mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true                <br />

                     shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by                <br />

                     That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;                <br />
                     That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:                <br />
                     The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,                <br />
                     Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,                <br />
                     And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona                <br />
                     A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;                <br />
                     Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure                <br />
                     I stand accountant for as great a sin,                <br />
                     But partly led to diet my revenge,                <br />
                     For that I do suspect the lusty Moor                <br />
                     Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof                <br />
                     Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;                <br />
                     And nothing can or shall content my soul                <br />
                     Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,                <br />
                     Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor                <br />
                     At least into a jealousy so strong                <br />
                     That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,                <br />
                     If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash                <br />
                     For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,                <br />
                     I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,                <br />
                     Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--                <br />
                     For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--                <br />
                     Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.                <br />
                     For making him egregiously an ass                <br />
                     And practising upon his peace and quiet                <br />
                     Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:                <br />
                     Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.                <br />

                     most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and                <br />

                     O sweet England!                <br />
                     King Stephen was a worthy peer,                <br />
                     His breeches cost him but a crown;                <br />
                     He held them sixpence all too dear,                <br />
                     With that he call'd the tailor lown.                <br />
                     He was a wight of high renown,                <br />
                     And thou art but of low degree:                <br />
                     'Tis pride that pulls the country down;                <br />
                     Then take thine auld cloak about thee.                <br />
                     Some wine, ho!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CASSIO</b>
                     Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CASSIO</b>
                     No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that                <br />
                     does those things. Well, God's above all; and there                <br />
                     be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.                <br />

                     Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my                <br />

                     Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,                <br />
                     In opposition bloody. I cannot speak                <br />

                     The gravity and stillness of your youth                <br />

                     That you unlace your reputation thus                <br />

                     Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:                <br />
                     Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--                <br />
                     While I spare speech, which something now                <br />
                     offends me,--                <br />
                     Of all that I do know: nor know I aught                <br />
                     By me that's said or done amiss this night;                <br />
                     Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,                <br />
                     And to defend ourselves it be a sin                <br />
                     When violence assails us.                <br />

                     My blood begins my safer guides to rule;                <br />
                     And passion, having my best judgment collied,                <br />
                     Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,                <br />
                     Or do but lift this arm, the best of you                <br />

                     Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,                <br />
                     Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,                <br />
                     To manage private and domestic quarrel,                <br />
                     In night, and on the court and guard of safety!                <br />

                     Touch me not so near:                <br />
                     I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth                <br />
                     Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;                <br />
                     Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth                <br />
                     Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.                <br />
                     Montano and myself being in speech,                <br />
                     There comes a fellow crying out for help:                <br />
                     And Cassio following him with determined sword,                <br />
                     To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman                <br />
                     Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:                <br />
                     Myself the crying fellow did pursue,                <br />
                     Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--                <br />
                     The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,                <br />
                     Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather                <br />
                     For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,                <br />
                     And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night                <br />
                     I ne'er might say before. When I came back--                <br />
                     For this was brief--I found them close together,                <br />
                     At blow and thrust; even as again they were                <br />
                     When you yourself did part them.                <br />
                     More of this matter cannot I report:                <br />
                     But men are men; the best sometimes forget:                <br />
                     Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,                <br />
                     As men in rage strike those that wish them best,                <br />
                     Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received                <br />
                     From him that fled some strange indignity,                <br />
                     Which patience could not pass.                <br />

                     You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.                <br />
                     I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife                <br />
                     is now the general: may say so in this respect, for                <br />
                     that he hath devoted and given up himself to the                <br />

                     graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune                <br />
                     her help to put you in your place again: she is of                <br />
                     so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,                <br />
                     she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more                <br />
                     than she is requested: this broken joint between                <br />
                     you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my                <br />
                     fortunes against any lay worth naming, this                <br />
                     crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.                <br />

                     beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:                <br />

                     And what's he then that says I play the villain?                <br />
                     When this advice is free I give and honest,                <br />
                     Probal to thinking and indeed the course                <br />
                     To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy                <br />
                     The inclining Desdemona to subdue                <br />
                     In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful                <br />
                     As the free elements. And then for her                <br />
                     To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,                <br />
                     All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,                <br />
                     His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,                <br />
                     That she may make, unmake, do what she list,                <br />
                     Even as her appetite shall play the god                <br />
                     With his weak function. How am I then a villain                <br />
                     To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,                <br />
                     Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!                <br />
                     When devils will the blackest sins put on,                <br />
                     They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,                <br />
                     As I do now: for whiles this honest fool                <br />
                     Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes                <br />
                     And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,                <br />
                     I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,                <br />
                     That she repeals him for her body's lust;                <br />
                     And by how much she strives to do him good,                <br />
                     She shall undo her credit with the Moor.                <br />
                     So will I turn her virtue into pitch,                <br />
                     And out of her own goodness make the net                <br />
                     That shall enmesh them all.                <br />

                     almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well                <br />
                     cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall                <br />

                     Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry                <br />
                     For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.                <br />
                     The general and his wife are talking of it;                <br />
                     And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,                <br />
                     That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,                <br />
                     And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom                <br />
                     He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you                <br />
                     And needs no other suitor but his likings                <br />
                     To take the safest occasion by the front                <br />
                     To bring you in again.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CASSIO</b>
                     Yet, I beseech you,                <br />
                     If you think fit, or that it may be done,                <br />
                     Give me advantage of some brief discourse                <br />
                     With Desdemona alone.                <br />

                     I will bestow you where you shall have time                <br />
                     To speak your bosom freely.                <br />

                     You have known him long; and be you well assured                <br />
                     He shall in strangeness stand no further off                <br />

                     That policy may either last so long,                <br />
                     Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,                <br />
                     Or breed itself so out of circumstance,                <br />
                     That, I being absent and my place supplied,                <br />
                     My general will forget my love and service.                <br />

                     If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it                <br />
                     To the last article: my lord shall never rest;                <br />
                     I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;                <br />
                     His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;                <br />
                     I'll intermingle every thing he does                <br />
                     With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;                <br />

                     Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,                <br />
                     If I have any grace or power to move you,                <br />
                     His present reconciliation take;                <br />
                     For if he be not one that truly loves you,                <br />
                     That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,                <br />
                     I have no judgment in an honest face:                <br />
                     I prithee, call him back.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DESDEMONA</b>
                     Ay, sooth; so humbled                <br />
                     That he hath left part of his grief with me,                <br />
                     To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     I shall not dine at home;                <br />
                     I meet the captains at the citadel.                <br />

                     On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:                <br />
                     I prithee, name the time, but let it not                <br />
                     Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;                <br />
                     And yet his trespass, in our common reason--                <br />
                     Save that, they say, the wars must make examples                <br />
                     Out of their best--is not almost a fault                <br />
                     To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?                <br />
                     Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,                <br />
                     What you would ask me, that I should deny,                <br />
                     Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,                <br />
                     That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,                <br />
                     When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,                <br />
                     Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do                <br />
                     To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;                <br />
                     I will deny thee nothing.                <br />

                     'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,                <br />
                     Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,                <br />
                     Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit                <br />
                     To your own person: nay, when I have a suit                <br />
                     Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,                <br />
                     It shall be full of poise and difficult weight                <br />
                     And fearful to be granted.                <br />

          <p>

                     I will deny thee nothing:                <br />
                     Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,                <br />
                     To leave me but a little to myself.                <br />

                     What dost thou say, Iago?                <br />

          <p>

                     Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,                <br />
                     Know of your love?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     But for a satisfaction of my thought;                <br />
                     No further harm.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Why of thy thought, Iago?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     I did not think he had been acquainted with her.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     O, yes; and went between us very oft.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Indeed!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?                <br />
                     Is he not honest?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Honest, my lord!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Honest! ay, honest.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     My lord, for aught I know.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     What dost thou think?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Think, my lord!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Think, my lord!                <br />
                     By heaven, he echoes me,                <br />
                     As if there were some monster in his thought                <br />
                     Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:                <br />
                     I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,                <br />
                     When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?                <br />
                     And when I told thee he was of my counsel                <br />
                     In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'                <br />
                     And didst contract and purse thy brow together,                <br />
                     As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain                <br />
                     Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,                <br />
                     Show me thy thought.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     My lord, you know I love you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     I think thou dost;                <br />
                     And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,                <br />
                     And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,                <br />
                     Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:                <br />
                     For such things in a false disloyal knave                <br />
                     Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just                <br />
                     They are close delations, working from the heart                <br />
                     That passion cannot rule.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     For Michael Cassio,                <br />
                     I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     I think so too.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Men should be what they seem;                <br />
                     Or those that be not, would they might seem none!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Certain, men should be what they seem.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Nay, yet there's more in this:                <br />
                     I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,                <br />
                     As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts                <br />
                     The worst of words.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Good my lord, pardon me:                <br />
                     Though I am bound to every act of duty,                <br />
                     I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.                <br />
                     Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;                <br />
                     As where's that palace whereinto foul things                <br />
                     Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,                <br />
                     But some uncleanly apprehensions                <br />
                     Keep leets and law-days and in session sit                <br />
                     With meditations lawful?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,                <br />
                     If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear                <br />
                     A stranger to thy thoughts.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     I do beseech you--                <br />
                     Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,                <br />
                     As, I confess, it is my nature's plague                <br />
                     To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy                <br />
                     Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,                <br />
                     From one that so imperfectly conceits,                <br />
                     Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble                <br />
                     Out of his scattering and unsure observance.                <br />
                     It were not for your quiet nor your good,                <br />
                     Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,                <br />
                     To let you know my thoughts.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     What dost thou mean?                <br />

                     Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,                <br />
                     Is the immediate jewel of their souls:                <br />
                     Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;                <br />
                     'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:                <br />
                     But he that filches from me my good name                <br />
                     Robs me of that which not enriches him                <br />
                     And makes me poor indeed.                <br />

                     O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;                <br />
                     It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock                <br />
                     The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss                <br />
                     Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;                <br />
                     But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er                <br />
                     Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     O misery!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Poor and content is rich and rich enough,                <br />
                     But riches fineless is as poor as winter                <br />
                     To him that ever fears he shall be poor.                <br />
                     Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend                <br />
                     From jealousy!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     Why, why is this?                <br />
                     Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,                <br />
                     To follow still the changes of the moon                <br />
                     With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt                <br />
                     Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,                <br />
                     When I shall turn the business of my soul                <br />
                     To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,                <br />
                     Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous                <br />
                     To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,                <br />
                     Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;                <br />
                     Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:                <br />
                     Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw                <br />
                     The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;                <br />
                     For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;                <br />
                     I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;                <br />
                     And on the proof, there is no more but this,--                <br />
                     Away at once with love or jealousy!                <br />

                     I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason                <br />
                     To show the love and duty that I bear you                <br />
                     With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,                <br />
                     Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.                <br />
                     Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;                <br />
                     Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:                <br />
                     I would not have your free and noble nature,                <br />
                     Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:                <br />
                     I know our country disposition well;                <br />
                     In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks                <br />
                     They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience                <br />
                     Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.                <br />

                     She did deceive her father, marrying you;                <br />
                     And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,                <br />
                     She loved them most.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Why, go to then;                <br />
                     She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,                <br />
                     To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-                <br />
                     He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;                <br />
                     I humbly do beseech you of your pardon                <br />
                     For too much loving you.                <br />

                     As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--                <br />

                     Not to affect many proposed matches                <br />

                     I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,                <br />
                     And let him find it. Trifles light as air                <br />

                     The Moor already changes with my poison:                <br />
                     Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.                <br />

                     It were a tedious difficulty, I think,                <br />
                     To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,                <br />
                     If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster                <br />
                     More than their own! What then? how then?                <br />
                     What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?                <br />
                     It is impossible you should see this,                <br />
                     Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,                <br />
                     As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross                <br />
                     As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,                <br />
                     If imputation and strong circumstances,                <br />
                     Which lead directly to the door of truth,                <br />
                     Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.                <br />

                     I could not sleep.                <br />
                     There are a kind of men so loose of soul,                <br />
                     That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:                <br />
                     One of this kind is Cassio:                <br />
                     In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,                <br />
                     Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'                <br />
                     And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,                <br />
                     Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,                <br />
                     As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots                <br />
                     That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg                <br />
                     Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then                <br />
                     Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'                <br />
          </p>

                     O monstrous! monstrous!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Nay, this was but his dream.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     But this denoted a foregone conclusion:                <br />
                     'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     And this may help to thicken other proofs                <br />
                     That do demonstrate thinly.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     I'll tear her all to pieces.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;                <br />
                     She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,                <br />
                     Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief                <br />
                     Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>
                     I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     I know not that; but such a handkerchief--                <br />
                     I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day                <br />
                     See Cassio wipe his beard with.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OTHELLO</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     If it be that, or any that was hers,                <br />
                     It speaks against her with the other proofs.                <br />

                     One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.                <br />
                     Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;                <br />
                     All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     I dare not say he lies any where.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DESDEMONA</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,                <br />
                     is stabbing.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">DESDEMONA</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DESDEMONA</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a                <br />
                     lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were                <br />
                     to lie in mine own throat.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DESDEMONA</b>
                     Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     I will catechise the world for him; that is, make                <br />

                     You may, indeed, say so;                <br />
                     For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.                <br />

                     That handkerchief                <br />
                     Did an Egyptian to my mother give;                <br />
                     She was a charmer, and could almost read                <br />
                     The thoughts of people: she told her, while                <br />
                     she kept it,                <br />
                     'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father                <br />
                     Entirely to her love, but if she lost it                <br />
                     Or made gift of it, my father's eye                <br />
                     Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt                <br />
                     After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;                <br />
                     And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,                <br />
                     To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;                <br />
                     Make it a darling like your precious eye;                <br />
                     To lose't or give't away were such perdition                <br />
                     As nothing else could match.                <br />

                     My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,                <br />

                     For let our finger ache, and it indues                <br />
                     Our other healthful members even to that sense                <br />
                     Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,                <br />
                     Nor of them look for such observances                <br />
                     As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,                <br />
                     I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,                <br />
                     Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;                <br />
                     But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,                <br />
                     And he's indicted falsely.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EMILIA</b>
                     Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,                <br />
                     And no conception nor no jealous toy                <br />
                     Concerning you.                <br />

                     But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;                <br />
                     They are not ever jealous for the cause,                <br />
                     But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster                <br />
                     Begot upon itself, born on itself.                <br />

                     Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,                <br />
                     More tedious than the dial eight score times?                <br />
                     O weary reckoning!                <br />

                     I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:                <br />
                     But I shall, in a more continuate time,                <br />
                     Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,                <br />

            <b class="speaker">BIANCA</b>
                     O Cassio, whence came this?                <br />
                     This is some token from a newer friend:                <br />
                     To the felt absence now I feel a cause:                <br />
                     Is't come to this? Well, well.                <br />

                     From whence you have them. You are jealous now                <br />
                     That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:                <br />
                     No, in good troth, Bianca.                <br />

                     I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.                <br />
                     I like the work well: ere it be demanded--                <br />
                     As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:                <br />
                     Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.                <br />

                     To have him see me woman'd.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CASSIO</b>
                     Not that I love you not.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIANCA</b>
                     But that you do not love me.                <br />
                     I pray you, bring me on the way a little,                <br />
                     And say if I shall see you soon at night.                <br />

                     passion without some instruction. It is not words                <br />
                     that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.                <br />
                     --Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--                <br />

                     A housewife that by selling her desires                <br />

                     He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain                <br />
                     From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">Re-enter CASSIO</i><br />

                     Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,                <br />

                     I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the                <br />

                     it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!                <br />
                     This is some minx's token, and I must take out the                <br />

                     Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,                <br />
                     I should have found in some place of my soul                <br />
                     A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me                <br />
                     A fixed figure for the time of scorn                <br />

                     Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:                <br />
                     But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,                <br />
                     Where either I must live, or bear no life;                <br />
                     The fountain from the which my current runs,                <br />
                     Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!                <br />
                     Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads                <br />
                     To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,                <br />
                     Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--                <br />
                     Ay, there, look grim as hell!                <br />

                     O good Iago,                <br />
                     What shall I do to win my lord again?                <br />
                     Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,                <br />
                     I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:                <br />
                     If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,                <br />
                     Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,                <br />
                     Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,                <br />
                     Delighted them in any other form;                <br />
                     Or that I do not yet, and ever did.                <br />
                     And ever will--though he do shake me off                <br />
                     To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,                <br />
                     Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;                <br />
                     And his unkindness may defeat my life,                <br />
                     But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'                <br />
                     It does abhor me now I speak the word;                <br />
                     To do the act that might the addition earn                <br />
                     Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:                <br />
                     The business of the state does him offence,                <br />
                     And he does chide with you.                <br />

          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     What in the contrary?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;                <br />
                     and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me                <br />
                     all conveniency than suppliest me with the least                <br />
                     advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure                <br />
                     it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what                <br />
                     already I have foolishly suffered.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Will you hear me, Roderigo?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and                <br />
                     performances are no kin together.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     You charge me most unjustly.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of                <br />
                     my means. The jewels you have had from me to                <br />
                     deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a                <br />
                     votarist: you have told me she hath received them                <br />
                     and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden                <br />
                     respect and acquaintance, but I find none.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Well; go to; very well.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis                <br />
                     not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin                <br />
                     to find myself fobbed in it.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Very well.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself                <br />
                     known to Desdemona: if she will return me my                <br />
                     jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my                <br />
                     unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I                <br />
                     will seek satisfaction of you.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     You have said now.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from                <br />
                     this instant to build on thee a better opinion than                <br />
                     ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast                <br />
                     taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I                <br />
                     protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     It hath not appeared.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your                <br />
                     suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,                <br />
                     Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I                <br />
                     have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean                <br />
                     purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if                <br />
                     thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,                <br />
                     take me from this world with treachery and devise                <br />
                     engines for my life.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice                <br />
                     to depute Cassio in Othello's place.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona                <br />
                     return again to Venice.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with                <br />
                     him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be                <br />
                     lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be                <br />
                     so determinate as the removing of Cassio.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     How do you mean, removing of him?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;                <br />
                     knocking out his brains.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     And that you would have me to do?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
                     Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.                <br />
                     He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I                <br />
                     go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable                <br />
                     fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which                <br />
                     I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,                <br />
                     you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near                <br />
                     to second your attempt, and he shall fall between                <br />
                     us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with                <br />
                     me; I will show you such a necessity in his death                <br />
                     that you shall think yourself bound to put it on                <br />
                     him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows                <br />
                     to waste: about it.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
                     I will hear further reason for this.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">IAGO</b>

                     My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:                <br />
                     She was in love, and he she loved proved mad                <br />
                     And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'                <br />
                     An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,                <br />
                     And she died singing it: that song to-night                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EMILIA</b>
                     Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would                <br />
                     store the world they played for.                <br />
                     But I do think it is their husbands' faults                <br />
                     If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,                <br />
                     And pour our treasures into foreign laps,                <br />
                     Or else break out in peevish jealousies,                <br />
                     Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,                <br />
                     Or scant our former having in despite;                <br />
                     Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,                <br />
                     Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know                <br />
                     Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell                <br />
                     And have their palates both for sweet and sour,                <br />
                     As husbands have. What is it that they do                <br />
                     When they change us for others? Is it sport?                <br />
                     I think it is: and doth affection breed it?                <br />
                     I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?                <br />
                     It is so too: and have not we affections,                <br />
                     Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?                <br />
                     Then let them use us well: else let them know,                <br />
                     The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.                <br />

                     It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--                <br />
                     Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--                <br />
                     It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;                <br />
                     Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,                <br />
                     And smooth as monumental alabaster.                <br />
                     Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.                <br />
                     Put out the light, and then put out the light:                <br />
                     If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,                <br />
                     I can again thy former light restore,                <br />
                     Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,                <br />
                     Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,                <br />
                     I know not where is that Promethean heat                <br />
                     That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,                <br />
                     I cannot give it vital growth again.                <br />
                     It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.                <br />

                     And love thee after. One more, and this the last:                <br />
                     So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,                <br />
                     But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;                <br />
                     It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.                <br />

                     Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.                <br />
                     'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--                <br />
                     The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?                <br />
                     Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--                <br />
                     I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?                <br />
                     If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:                <br />
                     My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.                <br />

                     It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--                <br />
                     O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.                <br />

                     Behold, I have a weapon;                <br />
                     A better never did itself sustain                <br />
                     Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,                <br />
                     That, with this little arm and this good sword,                <br />
                     I have made my way through more impediments                <br />
                     Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!                <br />
                     Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.                <br />
                     Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;                <br />
                     Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,                <br />
                     And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.                <br />
                     Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;                <br />
                     Man but a rush against Othello's breast,                <br />
                     And he retires. Where should Othello go?                <br />
                     Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!                <br />
                     Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,                <br />
                     This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,                <br />
                     And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!                <br />
                     Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!                <br />
                     Whip me, ye devils,                <br />
                     From the possession of this heavenly sight!                <br />
                     Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!                <br />
                     Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!                <br />

                     The death of Cassio to be undertook                <br />

                     Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;                <br />

                     And he himself confess'd but even now                <br />

                     How he upbraids Iago, that he made him                <br />

                     After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,                <br />
                     Iago set him on.                <br />

                     Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away                <br />
                     Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,                <br />

                     This is thy work: the object poisons sight;                <br />
                     Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,                <br />
                     And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,                <br />
                     For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,                <br />
                     Remains the censure of this hellish villain;                <br />
                     The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!                <br />
                     Myself will straight aboard: and to the state                <br />
                     This heavy act with heavy heart relate.                <br />
