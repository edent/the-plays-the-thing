                     Disasters in the sun; and the moist star

                     May give his saying deed; which is no further

                     Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

                     If with too credent ear you list his songs,

                     Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thy knotted and combined locks to part
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And each particular hair to stand on end,

                     Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:

                     The natural gates and alleys of the body,

                     And curd, like eager droppings into milk,

                     Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,

                     A couch for luxury and damned incest.

                     He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He falls to such perusal of my face
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     At last, a little shaking of mine arm
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For out o' doors he went without their helps,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And, to the last, bended their light on me.

                     And leads the will to desperate undertakings

                     The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,

                     Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:

                     Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
                  
                <br />

embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes
show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,
and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down
upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's
ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King
dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,
with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
seeming to lament with her. The dead body is
carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with
gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but

                     It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,

                     A brother's murder. Pray can I not,

                     And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,

                     Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;

                     My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?

                     That cannot be; since I am still possess'd

                     My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
                  
                <br />

                     Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,

                     And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     There is no shuffling, there the action lies
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,

                     To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
                  
                <br />

                     Yet what can it when one can not repent?
                  
                <br />

                     Where every god did seem to set his seal,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To give the world assurance of a man:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     You cannot call it love; for at your age
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But it reserved some quantity of choice,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or but a sickly part of one true sense
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Could not so mope.

                     O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
                  
                <br />

                     And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Since frost itself as actively doth burn
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And reason panders will.

                     The death I gave him. So, again, good night.

                     O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs

                     All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,

                     But in battalions. First, her father slain:

                     Laertes, was your father dear to you?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A face without a heart?
                  
                <br />

                     Why ask you this?
                  
                <br />

                     Not that I think you did not love your father;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But that I know love is begun by time;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And that I see, in passages of proof,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     There lives within the very flame of love
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And nothing is at a like goodness still;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Dies in his own too much: that we would do
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And hath abatements and delays as many
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To show yourself your father's son in deed
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     More than in words?

                     No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;

                     Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,

                     A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise

                     An earnest conjuration from the king,

                     As England was his faithful tributary,

                     As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear

                     And stand a comma 'tween their amities,

                     I had my father's signet in my purse,

                     Which was the model of that Danish seal;

                     Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
