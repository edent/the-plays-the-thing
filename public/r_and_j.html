To County Paris: then comes she to me,

Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,

<span class="line" id="line-3064">
A sleeping potion; which so took effect

As I intended, for it wrought on her

At the prefixed hour of her waking,
<a class="line" href="#line-3073">❦</a>

And bear this work of heaven with patience:
<a class="line" href="#line-3081">❦</a>
