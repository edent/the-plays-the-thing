                     It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:

                     We'll see these things effected to the full.

                     And lowly words were ransom for their fault.

                     That for the beauty thinks it excellent.

                     This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To rid us of the fear we have of him.

                     That he should die is worthy policy;

                     The king will labour still to save his life,

                     And yet we have but trivial argument,

                     More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.

                     And would not dash me with their ragged sides,

                     Might in thy palace perish Margaret.

                     As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,

                     When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,

                     I stood upon the hatches in the storm,

                     And when the dusky sky began to rob
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I took a costly jewel from my neck,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And even with this I lost fair England's view
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.

                     The agent of thy foul inconstancy,

                     To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did

                     His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!

                     Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     With full as many signs of deadly hate,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
                  
                <br />

                     Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,

                     And turn the force of them upon thyself.

                     You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?

                     O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,

                     That I may dew it with my mournful tears;

                     Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.

                     I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I am so angry at these abject terms;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I am far better born than is the king,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But I must make fair weather yet a while,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That I have given no answer all this while;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The cause why I have brought this army hither
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Seditious to his grace and to the state.

                     And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,

                     After them! nay, before them, if we can.

                     Shall be eternized in all age to come.
