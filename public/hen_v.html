O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend

So great an object: can this cockpit hold

The vasty fields of France? or may we cram

<h3>SCENE I.  London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-3">
My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-4">
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-5">
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-6">
But that the scambling and unquiet time
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-7">
Did push it out of farther question.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-9">
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-11">
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-12">
We lose the better half of our possession:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-13">
For all the temporal lands which men devout
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-14">
By testament have given to the church
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-15">
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-16">
As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-17">
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-18">
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-19">
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-20">
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-21">
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-22">
And to the coffers of the king beside,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-23">
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-25">
This would drink deep.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-27">
'Twould drink the cup and all.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-29">
But what prevention?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-31">
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-33">
And a true lover of the holy church.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-35">
The courses of his youth promised it not.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-36">
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-37">
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-38">
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-39">
Consideration, like an angel, came
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-40">
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-41">
Leaving his body as a paradise,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-42">
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-43">
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-44">
Never came reformation in a flood,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-45">
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-46">
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-47">
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-48">
As in this king.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-50">
We are blessed in the change.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-52">
Hear him but reason in divinity,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-53">
And all-admiring with an inward wish
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-54">
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-55">
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-56">
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-57">
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-58">
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-59">
Turn him to any cause of policy,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-60">
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-61">
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-62">
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-63">
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-64">
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-65">
So that the art and practic part of life
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-66">
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-67">
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-68">
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-69">
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-70">
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-71">
And never noted in him any study,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-72">
Any retirement, any sequestration
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-73">
From open haunts and popularity.
</span>

<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-75">
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-76">
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-77">
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-78">
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-79">
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-80">
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-81">
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-83">
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-84">
And therefore we must needs admit the means
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-85">
How things are perfected.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-87">
But, my good lord,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-88">
How now for mitigation of this bill
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-89">
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-90">
Incline to it, or no?
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-90">90</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-92">
He seems indifferent,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-93">
Or rather swaying more upon our part
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-94">
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-95">
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-96">
Upon our spiritual convocation
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-97">
And in regard of causes now in hand,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-98">
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-99">
As touching France, to give a greater sum
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-100">
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-101">
Did to his predecessors part withal.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-103">
How did this offer seem received, my lord?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-105">
With good acceptance of his majesty;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-106">
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-107">
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-108">
The severals and unhidden passages
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-109">
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-110">
And generally to the crown and seat of France
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-110">110</a>

Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ELY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-113">
What was the impediment that broke this off?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-115">
The French ambassador upon that instant
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-116">
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-117">
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

It is.
</span>
</p>
<p>

<span class="line" id="0-1-121">
Then go we in, to know his embassy;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-122">
Which I could with a ready guess declare,

<span class="line" id="0-1-123">
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

Why the law Salique that they have in France

That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,

Or nicely charge your understanding soul

With opening titles miscreate, whose right
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-28">
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-29">
For God doth know how many now in health

Shall drop their blood in approbation

Of what your reverence shall incite us to.

Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,

We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;

For never two such kingdoms did contend

'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords

That make such waste in brief mortality.

Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  <a class="line" href="#0-2-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-41">
For we will hear, note and believe in heart
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-42">
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd

As pure as sin with baptism.

<span class="line" id="0-2-48">
To make against your highness' claim to France
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-49">
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-50">
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
  <a class="line" href="#0-2-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-51">
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-52">
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-53">
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-54">
The founder of this law and female bar.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-55">
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-56">
That the land Salique is in Germany,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-57">
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-58">
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-59">
There left behind and settled certain French;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-60">
Who, holding in disdain the German women
  <a class="line" href="#0-2-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-61">
For some dishonest manners of their life,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-62">
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female

<span class="line" id="0-2-63">
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-64">
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-65">
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-66">
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-67">
Was not devised for the realm of France:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-68">
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-69">
Until four hundred one and twenty years
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-70">
After defunction of King Pharamond,

Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-2-74">
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French

Beyond the river Sala, in the year

Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
