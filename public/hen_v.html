As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,

Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,

Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;

The courses of his youth promised it not.

The breath no sooner left his father's body,

But that his wildness, mortified in him,

Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment

Consideration, like an angel, came

And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,

Leaving his body as a paradise,

To envelop and contain celestial spirits.

Never came reformation in a flood,

Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness

Hear him but reason in divinity,
<a class="line" href="#line-74">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-75">
And all-admiring with an inward wish
<a class="line" href="#line-75">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-76">
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
<a class="line" href="#line-76">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-77">
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
<a class="line" href="#line-77">❦</a></span>

You would say it hath been all in all his study:
<a class="line" href="#line-78">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-79">
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
<a class="line" href="#line-79">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-80">
A fearful battle render'd you in music:

Turn him to any cause of policy,

The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
<a class="line" href="#line-84">❦</a></span>

And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,

<span class="line" id="line-86">
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
<a class="line" href="#line-86">❦</a></span>

So that the art and practic part of life

Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
<a class="line" href="#line-89">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-90">
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
<a class="line" href="#line-90">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-91">
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
<a class="line" href="#line-91">❦</a></span>

His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,

<span class="line" id="line-93">
And never noted in him any study,

Any retirement, any sequestration

Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
