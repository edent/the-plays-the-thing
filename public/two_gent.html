Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:

To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;

Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth

With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
<a class="line" href="#line-32">❦</a></span>

If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;

If lost, why then a grievous labour won;

However, but a folly bought with wit,

So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.

Love is your master, for he masters you:

And he that is so yoked by a fool,

Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud

Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,

Even so by love the young and tender wit
<a class="line" href="#line-48">❦</a></span>

Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,

Losing his verdure even in the prime

And all the fair effects of future hopes.
