<h2>ACT I</h2>
<div class="scene">
<h3>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
<br />
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
<br />
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
<br />
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
<br />
I rather would entreat thy company
<br />
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
<br />
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
<br />
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
<br />
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
<br />
Even as I would when I to love begin.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
<br />
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
<br />
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
<br />
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
<br />
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
<br />
If ever danger do environ thee,
<br />
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
<br />
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
And on a love-book pray for my success?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
That's on some shallow story of deep love:
<br />
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
That's a deep story of a deeper love:
<br />
For he was more than over shoes in love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
<br />
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
What?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
<br />
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
<br />
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
<br />
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
<br />
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
<br />
However, but a folly bought with wit,
<br />
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Love is your master, for he masters you:
<br />
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
<br />
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
<br />
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
<br />
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
And writers say, as the most forward bud
<br />
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
<br />
Even so by love the young and tender wit
<br />
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
<br />
Losing his verdure even in the prime
<br />
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
<br />
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
<br />
That art a votary to fond desire?
<br />
Once more adieu! my father at the road
<br />
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
<br />
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
<br />
Of thy success in love, and what news else
<br />
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
<br />
And likewise will visit thee with mine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
He after honour hunts, I after love:
<br />
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
<br />
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
<br />
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
<br />
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
<br />
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
<br />
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter SPEED</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
<br />
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
<br />
An if the shepherd be a while away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
<br />
and I a sheep?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I do.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
This proves me still a sheep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
True; and thy master a shepherd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
<br />
shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
<br />
not me: therefore I am no sheep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
<br />
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
<br />
wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
<br />
follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
<br />
a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
<br />
lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
<br />
carrying your letter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
<br />
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
<br />
your lover.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
But what said she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
<i class="parenthetical">First nodding</i>
Ay.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
<br />
me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
And that set together is noddy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
<br />
take it for your pains.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Why sir, how do you bear with me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
<br />
but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
<br />
be both at once delivered.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
<br />
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
<br />
and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
<br />
fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
<br />
mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
<br />
hard as steel.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
What said she? nothing?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
<br />
testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
<br />
me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
<br />
letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
<br />
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
<br />
Being destined to a drier death on shore.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit SPEED</i><br />
I must go send some better messenger:
<br />
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
<br />
Receiving them from such a worthless post.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. Garden of JULIA's house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter JULlA and LUCETTA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
<br />
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
<br />
That every day with parle encounter me,
<br />
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
<br />
According to my shallow simple skill.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
<br />
But, were I you, he never should be mine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
How now! what means this passion at his name?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
<br />
That I, unworthy body as I am,
<br />
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Then thus: of many good I think him best.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Your reason?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
I have no other, but a woman's reason;
<br />
I think him so because I think him so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
His little speaking shows his love but small.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
They do not love that do not show their love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
O, they love least that let men know their love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
I would I knew his mind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Peruse this paper, madam.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
'To Julia.' Say, from whom?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
That the contents will show.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Say, say, who gave it thee?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
<br />
He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
<br />
Did in your name receive it: pardon the
<br />
fault I pray.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
<br />
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
<br />
To whisper and conspire against my youth?
<br />
Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
<br />
And you an officer fit for the place.
<br />
Or else return no more into my sight.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Will ye be gone?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
That you may ruminate.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
<br />
It were a shame to call her back again
<br />
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
<br />
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
<br />
And would not force the letter to my view!
<br />
Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
<br />
Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
<br />
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
<br />
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
<br />
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
<br />
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
<br />
When willingly I would have had her here!
<br />
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
<br />
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
<br />
My penance is to call Lucetta back
<br />
And ask remission for my folly past.
<br />
What ho! Lucetta!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter LUCETTA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
What would your ladyship?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Is't near dinner-time?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
I would it were,
<br />
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
<br />
And not upon your maid.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
What is't that you took up so gingerly?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Nothing.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Why didst thou stoop, then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
To take a paper up that I let fall.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
And is that paper nothing?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Nothing concerning me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
<br />
Unless it have a false interpeter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
<br />
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
As little by such toys as may be possible.
<br />
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
And why not you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
I cannot reach so high.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Let's see your song. How now, minion!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
<br />
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
You do not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
No, madam; it is too sharp.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
You, minion, are too saucy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Nay, now you are too flat
<br />
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
<br />
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
<br />
Here is a coil with protestation!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Tears the letter</i><br />
Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
<br />
You would be fingering them, to anger me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
<br />
To be so anger'd with another letter.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
<br />
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
<br />
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
<br />
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
<br />
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
<br />
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
<br />
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
<br />
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
<br />
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
<br />
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
<br />
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
<br />
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
<br />
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
<br />
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
<br />
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
<br />
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
<br />
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
<br />
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
<br />
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
<br />
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
<br />
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
<br />
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
<br />
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
<br />
He couples it to his complaining names.
<br />
Thus will I fold them one on another:
<br />
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter LUCETTA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Madam,
<br />
Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Well, let us go.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
If you respect them, best to take them up.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
<br />
Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
I see you have a month's mind to them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
<br />
I see things too, although you judge I wink.

<h3>SCENE III.  The same. ANTONIO's house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
<br />
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Why, what of him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
He wonder'd that your lordship
<br />
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
<br />
While other men, of slender reputation,
<br />
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
<br />
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
<br />
Some to discover islands far away;
<br />
Some to the studious universities.
<br />
For any or for all these exercises,
<br />
He said that Proteus your son was meet,
<br />
And did request me to importune you
<br />
To let him spend his time no more at home,
<br />
Which would be great impeachment to his age,
<br />
In having known no travel in his youth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
<br />
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
<br />
I have consider'd well his loss of time
<br />
And how he cannot be a perfect man,
<br />
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
<br />
Experience is by industry achieved
<br />
And perfected by the swift course of time.
<br />
Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
I think your lordship is not ignorant
<br />
How his companion, youthful Valentine,
<br />
Attends the emperor in his royal court.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
I know it well.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
<br />
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
<br />
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
<br />
And be in eye of every exercise
<br />
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
<br />
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
<br />
The execution of it shall make known.
<br />
Even with the speediest expedition
<br />
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
<br />
With other gentlemen of good esteem,
<br />
Are journeying to salute the emperor
<br />
And to commend their service to his will.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
<br />
And, in good time! now will we break with him.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
<br />
Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
<br />
Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
<br />
O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
<br />
To seal our happiness with their consents!
<br />
O heavenly Julia!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
How now! what letter are you reading there?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
<br />
Of commendations sent from Valentine,
<br />
Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
<br />
How happily he lives, how well beloved
<br />
And daily graced by the emperor;
<br />
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
And how stand you affected to his wish?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
As one relying on your lordship's will
<br />
And not depending on his friendly wish.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
My will is something sorted with his wish.
<br />
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
<br />
For what I will, I will, and there an end.
<br />
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
<br />
With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
<br />
What maintenance he from his friends receives,
<br />
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
<br />
To-morrow be in readiness to go:
<br />
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
<br />
Please you, deliberate a day or two.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
<br />
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
<br />
Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
<br />
To hasten on his expedition.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
<br />
And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
<br />
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
<br />
Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
<br />
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
<br />
Hath he excepted most against my love.
<br />
O, how this spring of love resembleth
<br />
The uncertain glory of an April day,
<br />
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
<br />
And by and by a cloud takes all away!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter PANTHINO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
<br />
He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
<br />
And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'

<h3>SCENE I.  Milan. The DUKE's palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter VALENTINE and SPEED</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Sir, your glove.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Not mine; my gloves are on.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
<br />
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
<br />
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
How now, sirrah?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
She is not within hearing, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why, sir, who bade you call her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Well, you'll still be too forward.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
She that your worship loves?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why, how know you that I am in love?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
<br />
learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
<br />
like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
<br />
robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
<br />
the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
<br />
lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
<br />
buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
<br />
diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
<br />
speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
<br />
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
<br />
walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
<br />
fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
<br />
looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
<br />
are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
<br />
on you, I can hardly think you my master.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Are all these things perceived in me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
They are all perceived without ye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Without me? they cannot.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
<br />
were so simple, none else would: but you are so
<br />
without these follies, that these follies are within
<br />
you and shine through you like the water in an
<br />
urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
<br />
physician to comment on your malady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Why, sir, I know her not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
<br />
knowest her not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Sir, I know that well enough.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
What dost thou know?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
That's because the one is painted and the other out
<br />
of all count.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
How painted? and how out of count?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
<br />
man counts of her beauty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
You never saw her since she was deformed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
How long hath she been deformed?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Ever since you loved her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
<br />
see her beautiful.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
If you love her, you cannot see her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
<br />
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
<br />
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
<br />
ungartered!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
What should I see then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
<br />
for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
<br />
hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
<br />
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
<br />
you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
<br />
bolder to chide you for yours.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
<br />
one she loves.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
And have you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I have.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Are they not lamely writ?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
<br />
here she comes.
<br />
</p>

O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!

Now will he interpret to her.

Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.

O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.

Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.

<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
He should give her interest and she gives it him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
<br />
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
<br />
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
<br />
But for my duty to your ladyship.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
<br />
For being ignorant to whom it goes
<br />
I writ at random, very doubtfully.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
<br />
Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
<br />
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
<br />
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
<br />
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
<br />
But since unwillingly, take them again.
<br />
Nay, take them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Madam, they are for you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
<br />
But I will none of them; they are for you;
<br />
I would have had them writ more movingly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
<br />
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
If it please me, madam, what then?

O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,

<br />
My master sues to her, and she hath
<br />
taught her suitor,
<br />
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
<br />
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
<br />
That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
<br />
the letter?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
To do what?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
To whom?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
What figure?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
By a letter, I should say.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why, she hath not writ to me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
What need she, when she hath made you write to
<br />
yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No, believe me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
<br />
her earnest?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
She gave me none, except an angry word.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Why, she hath given you a letter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
That's the letter I writ to her friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I would it were no worse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
<br />
For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
<br />
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
<br />
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
<br />
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
<br />
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
<br />
Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I have dined.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SPEED</b>
Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
<br />
feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my

victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like

your mistress; be moved, be moved.

wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat

wringing her hands, and all our house in a great

wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,

<br />
hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
<br />
it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
<br />
on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
<br />
sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
<br />
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
<br />
am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
<br />
dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
<br />
so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
<br />
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
<br />
now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
<br />
come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
<br />
like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
<br />
'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
<br />
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
<br />
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
<br />
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.

<p class="stagedir">Enter PANTHINO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
<br />
and thou art to post after with oars. What's the

matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
<br />
lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
<br />
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
What's the unkindest tide?

Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
<br />
losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
<br />
thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
<br />
master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
<br />
service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?
<br />
</p>
<p>

For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.

<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
In thy tail!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
<br />
the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
<br />
were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
<br />
wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PANTHINO</b>
Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>

Sir, call me what thou darest.

Well, I will go.

Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.

Ay, boy, it's for love.

Servant, you are sad.

<p>

Indeed, madam, I seem so.

</p>
<p>

Seem you that you are not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Haply I do.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
So do counterfeits.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
So do you.

What seem I that I am not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Wise.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
What instance of the contrary?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Your folly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
And how quote you my folly?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I quote it in your jerkin.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
My jerkin is a doublet.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Well, then, I'll double your folly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
How?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
<br />
in your air.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
You have said, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Who is that, servant?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
<br />
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,
<br />
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
<br />
make your wit bankrupt.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
<br />
and, I think, no other treasure to give your

followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
<br />
that they live by your bare words.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DUKE</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
<br />
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
<br />
What say you to a letter from your friends
<br />
Of much good news?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
My lord, I will be thankful.
<br />
To any happy messenger from thence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
<br />
To be of worth and worthy estimation
<br />
And not without desert so well reputed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Hath he not a son?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
<br />
The honour and regard of such a father.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
You know him well?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I know him as myself; for from our infancy
<br />
We have conversed and spent our hours together:
<br />
And though myself have been an idle truant,
<br />
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
<br />
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
<br />
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
<br />
Made use and fair advantage of his days;
<br />
His years but young, but his experience old;
<br />
His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
<br />
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
<br />
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
<br />
He is complete in feature and in mind
<br />
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
<br />
He is as worthy for an empress' love
<br />
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
<br />
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
<br />
With commendation from great potentates;
<br />
And here he means to spend his time awhile:
<br />
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Welcome him then according to his worth.
<br />
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
<br />
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
<br />
I will send him hither to you presently.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
<br />
Had come along with me, but that his mistress
<br />
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
<br />
Upon some other pawn for fealty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
<br />
How could he see his way to seek out you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
<br />
Upon a homely object Love can wink.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit THURIO</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
<br />
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
<br />
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
<br />
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
<br />
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Leave off discourse of disability:
<br />
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
And duty never yet did want his meed:
<br />
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
That you are welcome?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
That you are worthless.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter THURIO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
<br />
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
<br />
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
<br />
When you have done, we look to hear from you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Your friends are well and have them much commended.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
And how do yours?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I left them all in health.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
My tales of love were wont to weary you;
<br />
I know you joy not in a love discourse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
<br />
I have done penance for contemning Love,
<br />
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
<br />
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
<br />
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
<br />
For in revenge of my contempt of love,
<br />
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
<br />
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
<br />
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
<br />
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
<br />
There is no woe to his correction,
<br />
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
<br />
Now no discourse, except it be of love;
<br />
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
<br />
Upon the very naked name of love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
<br />
Was this the idol that you worship so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
No; but she is an earthly paragon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Call her divine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I will not flatter her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
<br />
And I must minister the like to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
<br />
Yet let her be a principality,
<br />
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Except my mistress.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Sweet, except not any;
<br />
Except thou wilt except against my love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
And I will help thee to prefer her too:
<br />
She shall be dignified with this high honour--
<br />
To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
<br />
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
<br />
And, of so great a favour growing proud,
<br />
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
<br />
And make rough winter everlastingly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
<br />
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
<br />
She is alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Then let her alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
<br />
And I as rich in having such a jewel
<br />
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
<br />
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
<br />
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
<br />
Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
<br />
My foolish rival, that her father likes
<br />
Only for his possessions are so huge,
<br />
Is gone with her along, and I must after,
<br />
For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
But she loves you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
<br />
marriage-hour,
<br />
With all the cunning manner of our flight,
<br />
Determined of; how I must climb her window,
<br />
The ladder made of cords, and all the means
<br />
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
<br />
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
<br />
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
<br />
I must unto the road, to disembark
<br />
Some necessaries that I needs must use,
<br />
And then I'll presently attend you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Will you make haste?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I will.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit VALENTINE</i><br />
Even as one heat another heat expels,
<br />
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
<br />
So the remembrance of my former love
<br />
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
<br />
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
<br />
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
<br />
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
<br />
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
<br />
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
<br />
Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
<br />
Bears no impression of the thing it was.
<br />
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
<br />
And that I love him not as I was wont.
<br />
O, but I love his lady too too much,
<br />
And that's the reason I love him so little.
<br />
How shall I dote on her with more advice,
<br />
That thus without advice begin to love her!
<br />
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
<br />
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
<br />
But when I look on her perfections,
<br />
There is no reason but I shall be blind.
<br />
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
<br />
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not

Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you

Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very

No, neither.

No, they are both as whole as a fish.

Why, then, how stands the matter with them?

<h3>SCENE VI.  The same. The DUKE'S palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
<br />
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
<br />
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
<br />
And even that power which gave me first my oath
<br />
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
<br />
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
<br />
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
<br />
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
<br />
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
<br />
But now I worship a celestial sun.
<br />
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
<br />
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
<br />
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
<br />
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
<br />
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
<br />
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
<br />
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
<br />
But there I leave to love where I should love.
<br />
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
<br />
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
<br />
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
<br />
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
<br />
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
<br />
For love is still most precious in itself;
<br />
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
<br />
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
<br />
I will forget that Julia is alive,
<br />
Remembering that my love to her is dead;
<br />
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
<br />
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
<br />
I cannot now prove constant to myself,
<br />
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
<br />
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
<br />
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
<br />
Myself in counsel, his competitor.
<br />
Now presently I'll give her father notice
<br />
Of their disguising and pretended flight;
<br />
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
<br />
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
<br />
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
<br />
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
<br />
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
<br />
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

<h3>SCENE VII.  Verona. JULIA'S house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter JULIA and LUCETTA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
<br />
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
<br />
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
<br />
Are visibly character'd and engraved,
<br />
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
<br />
How, with my honour, I may undertake
<br />
A journey to my loving Proteus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
<br />
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
<br />
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
<br />
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
<br />
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Better forbear till Proteus make return.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
<br />
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
<br />
By longing for that food so long a time.
<br />
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
<br />
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
<br />
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
<br />
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
<br />
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
<br />
The current that with gentle murmur glides,
<br />
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
<br />
But when his fair course is not hindered,
<br />
He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
<br />
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
<br />
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
<br />
And so by many winding nooks he strays
<br />
With willing sport to the wild ocean.
<br />
Then let me go and hinder not my course
<br />
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
<br />
And make a pastime of each weary step,
<br />
Till the last step have brought me to my love;
<br />
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
<br />
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
But in what habit will you go along?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Not like a woman; for I would prevent
<br />
The loose encounters of lascivious men:
<br />
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
<br />
As may beseem some well-reputed page.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
<br />
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
<br />
To be fantastic may become a youth
<br />
Of greater time than I shall show to be.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
<br />
What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
<br />
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
<br />
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
<br />
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
<br />
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
<br />
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
<br />
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Nay, that I will not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Then never dream on infamy, but go.
<br />
If Proteus like your journey when you come,
<br />
No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
<br />
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
<br />
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
<br />
And instances of infinite of love
<br />
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
All these are servants to deceitful men.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Base men, that use them to so base effect!
<br />
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
<br />
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
<br />
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
<br />
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
<br />
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCETTA</b>
Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
<br />
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
<br />
Only deserve my love by loving him;
<br />
And presently go with me to my chamber,
<br />
To take a note of what I stand in need of,
<br />
To furnish me upon my longing journey.
<br />
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
<br />
My goods, my lands, my reputation;
<br />
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
<br />
Come, answer not, but to it presently!
<br />
I am impatient of my tarriance.

<h3>SCENE I.  Milan. The DUKE's palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
<br />
We have some secrets to confer about.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit THURIO</i><br />
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
My gracious lord, that which I would discover
<br />
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
<br />
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
<br />
Done to me, undeserving as I am,
<br />
My duty pricks me on to utter that
<br />
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
<br />
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
<br />
This night intends to steal away your daughter:
<br />
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
<br />
I know you have determined to bestow her
<br />
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
<br />
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
<br />
It would be much vexation to your age.
<br />
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
<br />
To cross my friend in his intended drift
<br />
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
<br />
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
<br />
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
<br />
Which to requite, command me while I live.
<br />
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
<br />
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
<br />
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
<br />
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
<br />
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
<br />
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
<br />
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
<br />
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
<br />
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
<br />
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
<br />
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
<br />
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
<br />
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
<br />
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
<br />
How he her chamber-window will ascend
<br />
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
<br />
For which the youthful lover now is gone
<br />
And this way comes he with it presently;
<br />
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
<br />
But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
<br />
That my discovery be not aimed at;
<br />
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
<br />
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Upon mine honour, he shall never know
<br />
That I had any light from thee of this.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter VALENTINE</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Please it your grace, there is a messenger
<br />
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
<br />
And I am going to deliver them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Be they of much import?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
The tenor of them doth but signify
<br />
My health and happy being at your court.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
<br />
I am to break with thee of some affairs
<br />
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
<br />
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
<br />
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
<br />
Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
<br />
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
<br />
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
<br />
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
<br />
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
<br />
Neither regarding that she is my child
<br />
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
<br />
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
<br />
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
<br />
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
<br />
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
<br />
I now am full resolved to take a wife
<br />
And turn her out to who will take her in:
<br />
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
<br />
For me and my possessions she esteems not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
What would your Grace have me to do in this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
There is a lady in Verona here
<br />
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
<br />
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
<br />
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
<br />
For long agone I have forgot to court;
<br />
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
<br />
How and which way I may bestow myself
<br />
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
<br />
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
<br />
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
<br />
Send her another; never give her o'er;
<br />
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
<br />
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
<br />
But rather to beget more love in you:
<br />
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
<br />
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
<br />
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
<br />
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
<br />
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
<br />
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
<br />
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
<br />
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
But she I mean is promised by her friends
<br />
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
<br />
And kept severely from resort of men,
<br />
That no man hath access by day to her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
<br />
That no man hath recourse to her by night.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
What lets but one may enter at her window?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
<br />
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
<br />
Without apparent hazard of his life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
<br />
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
<br />
Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
<br />
So bold Leander would adventure it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
<br />
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
This very night; for Love is like a child,
<br />
That longs for every thing that he can come by.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
<br />
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
<br />
Under a cloak that is of any length.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ay, my good lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Then let me see thy cloak:
<br />
I'll get me one of such another length.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
<br />
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
<br />
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
<br />
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
<br />
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Reads</i><br />
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
<br />
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
<br />
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
<br />
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
<br />
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
<br />
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
<br />
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
<br />
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
<br />
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
<br />
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
<br />
What's here?
<br />
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
<br />
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
<br />
Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
<br />
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
<br />
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
<br />
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
<br />
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
<br />
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
<br />
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
<br />
Is privilege for thy departure hence:
<br />
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
<br />
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
<br />
But if thou linger in my territories
<br />
Longer than swiftest expedition
<br />
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
<br />
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
<br />
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
<br />
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
<br />
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
And why not death rather than living torment?
<br />
To die is to be banish'd from myself;
<br />
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
<br />
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
<br />
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
<br />
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
<br />
Unless it be to think that she is by
<br />
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
<br />
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
<br />
There is no music in the nightingale;
<br />
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
<br />
There is no day for me to look upon;
<br />
She is my essence, and I leave to be,
<br />
If I be not by her fair influence
<br />
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
<br />
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
<br />
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
<br />
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
No, Valentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
<br />
Hath she forsworn me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
No, Valentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
<br />
What is your news?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
<br />
From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
O, I have fed upon this woe already,
<br />
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
<br />
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--
<br />
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
<br />
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
<br />
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
<br />
With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
<br />
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
<br />
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
<br />
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
<br />
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
<br />
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
<br />
But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
<br />
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
<br />
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
<br />
That to close prison he commanded her,
<br />
With many bitter threats of biding there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
<br />
Have some malignant power upon my life:
<br />
If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
<br />
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
<br />
And study help for that which thou lament'st.
<br />
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
<br />
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
<br />
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
<br />
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
<br />
And manage it against despairing thoughts.
<br />
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
<br />
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
<br />
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
<br />
The time now serves not to expostulate:
<br />
Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;
<br />
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
<br />
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
<br />
As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
<br />
Regard thy danger, and along with me!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
<br />
Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
<br />

I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to

think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's

all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now

team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who

'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I

will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
<br />
'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis

a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. The DUKE's palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DUKE and THURIO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
<br />
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Since his exile she hath despised me most,
<br />
Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
<br />
That I am desperate of obtaining her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
This weak impress of love is as a figure
<br />
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
<br />
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
<br />
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
<br />
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS</i><br />
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
<br />
According to our proclamation gone?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Gone, my good lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
My daughter takes his going grievously.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
<br />
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
<br />
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
<br />
Makes me the better to confer with thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
<br />
Let me not live to look upon your grace.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
<br />
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I do, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
<br />
How she opposes her against my will
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
<br />
What might we do to make the girl forget
<br />
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
The best way is to slander Valentine
<br />
With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
<br />
Three things that women highly hold in hate.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
<br />
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
<br />
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Then you must undertake to slander him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
<br />
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
<br />
Especially against his very friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Where your good word cannot advantage him,
<br />
Your slander never can endamage him;
<br />
Therefore the office is indifferent,
<br />
Being entreated to it by your friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
<br />
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
<br />
She shall not long continue love to him.
<br />
But say this weed her love from Valentine,
<br />
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
<br />
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
<br />
You must provide to bottom it on me;
<br />
Which must be done by praising me as much
<br />
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
<br />
Because we know, on Valentine's report,
<br />
You are already Love's firm votary
<br />
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
<br />
Upon this warrant shall you have access
<br />
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
<br />
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
<br />
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
<br />
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
<br />
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
As much as I can do, I will effect:
<br />
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
<br />
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
<br />
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
<br />
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Ay,
<br />
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Say that upon the altar of her beauty
<br />
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
<br />
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
<br />
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
<br />
That may discover such integrity:
<br />
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
<br />
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
<br />
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
<br />
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
<br />
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
<br />
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
<br />
With some sweet concert; to their instruments
<br />
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
<br />
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
<br />
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
<br />
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
<br />
Let us into the city presently
<br />
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
<br />
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
<br />
To give the onset to thy good advice.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
About it, gentlemen!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
<br />
And afterward determine our proceedings.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Even now about it! I will pardon you.

For that which now torments me to rehearse:

I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;

But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
<br />
Without false vantage or base treachery.
<br />

Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.

But were you banish'd for so small a fault?

I was, and held me glad of such a doom.

<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Peace, villain!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Outlaw</b>
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Nothing but my fortune.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Outlaw</b>
Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
<br />
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
<br />
Thrust from the company of awful men:
<br />
Myself was from Verona banished
<br />
For practising to steal away a lady,
<br />
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Outlaw</b>
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
<br />
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Outlaw</b>
And I for such like petty crimes as these,
<br />
But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
<br />
That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
<br />
And partly, seeing you are beautified
<br />
With goodly shape and by your own report
<br />
A linguist and a man of such perfection
<br />
As we do in our quality much want--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Outlaw</b>
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
<br />
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
<br />
Are you content to be our general?
<br />
To make a virtue of necessity
<br />
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Outlaw</b>
What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
<br />
Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
<br />
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
<br />
Love thee as our commander and our king.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Outlaw</b>
But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Outlaw</b>
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I take your offer and will live with you,
<br />
Provided that you do no outrages
<br />
On silly women or poor passengers.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Outlaw</b>
No, we detest such vile base practises.
<br />
Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
<br />
And show thee all the treasure we have got,
<br />
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

<h3>SCENE II.  Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Already have I been false to Valentine
<br />
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
<br />
Under the colour of commending him,
<br />
I have access my own love to prefer:
<br />
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
<br />
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
<br />
When I protest true loyalty to her,
<br />
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
<br />
When to her beauty I commend my vows,
<br />
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
<br />
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
<br />
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
<br />
The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
<br />
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
<br />
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
<br />
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
<br />
And give some evening music to her ear.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter THURIO and Musicians</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
<br />
Will creep in service where it cannot go.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Who? Silvia?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Ay, Silvia; for your sake.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
<br />
Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
<br />
pray you, why is it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
<br />
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
But shall I hear him speak?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Ay, that you shall.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
That will be music.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">SONG.</i><br />
Who is Silvia? what is she,
<br />
That all our swains commend her?
<br />
Holy, fair and wise is she;
<br />
The heaven such grace did lend her,
<br />
That she might admired be.
<br />
Is she kind as she is fair?
<br />
For beauty lives with kindness.
<br />
Love doth to her eyes repair,
<br />
To help him of his blindness,
<br />
And, being help'd, inhabits there.
<br />
Then to Silvia let us sing,
<br />
That Silvia is excelling;
<br />
She excels each mortal thing
<br />
Upon the dull earth dwelling:
<br />
To her let us garlands bring.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
<br />
do you, man? the music likes you not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
You mistake; the musician likes me not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Why, my pretty youth?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
He plays false, father.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
How? out of tune on the strings?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
<br />
heart-strings.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
You have a quick ear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
I perceive you delight not in music.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Not a whit, when it jars so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Ay, that change is the spite.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
You would have them always play but one thing?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
I would always have one play but one thing.
<br />
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
<br />
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
<br />
her out of all nick.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Where is Launce?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Host</b>
Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
<br />
master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
<br />
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Where meet we?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
At Saint Gregory's well.

Madam, good even to your ladyship.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
<br />
Who is that that spake?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
<br />
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Sir Proteus, as I take it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
What's your will?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
That I may compass yours.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
You have your wish; my will is even this:
<br />
That presently you hie you home to bed.
<br />
Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
<br />
Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
<br />
To be seduced by thy flattery,
<br />
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
<br />
Return, return, and make thy love amends.
<br />
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
<br />
I am so far from granting thy request
<br />
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
<br />
And by and by intend to chide myself
<br />
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
<br />
But she is dead.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
'Twere false, if I should speak it;
<br />
For I am sure she is not buried.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
<br />
Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
<br />
I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
<br />
To wrong him with thy importunacy?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
And so suppose am I; for in his grave
<br />
Assure thyself my love is buried.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
<br />
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
He heard not that.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
<br />
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
<br />
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
<br />
To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
<br />
For since the substance of your perfect self
<br />
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
<br />
And to your shadow will I make true love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
<br />
deceive it,
<br />
And make it but a shadow, as I am.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
<br />
But since your falsehood shall become you well
<br />
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
<br />
Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
<br />
And so, good rest.
<br />

Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?

Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost

day.

This is the hour that Madam Silvia

There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.

Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
<br />
According to your ladyship's impose,
<br />
I am thus early come to know what service
<br />
It is your pleasure to command me in.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
<br />
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
<br />
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:
<br />
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
<br />
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
<br />
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
<br />
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
<br />
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
<br />
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
<br />
As when thy lady and thy true love died,
<br />
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
<br />
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
<br />
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
<br />
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
<br />
I do desire thy worthy company,
<br />
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
<br />
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
<br />
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
<br />
And on the justice of my flying hence,
<br />
To keep me from a most unholy match,
<br />
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
<br />
I do desire thee, even from a heart
<br />
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
<br />
To bear me company and go with me:
<br />
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
<br />
That I may venture to depart alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EGLAMOUR</b>
Madam, I pity much your grievances;
<br />
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
<br />
I give consent to go along with you,

Recking as little what betideth me
<br />
As much I wish all good befortune you.

When will you go?

<h3>SCENE IV.  The same. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
<br />
look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
<br />
puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
<br />
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
<br />
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
<br />
'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
<br />
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
<br />
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
<br />
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
<br />
O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
<br />
in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
<br />
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
<br />
as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
<br />
more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
<br />
I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
<br />
live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
<br />
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
<br />
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
<br />
not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
<br />
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
<br />
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
<br />
out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
<br />
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
<br />
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
<br />
whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
<br />
the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
<br />
the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
<br />
wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
<br />
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
<br />
his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
<br />
stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
<br />
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
<br />
he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
<br />
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
<br />
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
<br />
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
<br />
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
<br />
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
<br />
thou ever see me do such a trick?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS and JULIA</p>

How now, you whoreson peasant!
<br />
Where have you been these two days loitering?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
And what says she to my little jewel?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
<br />
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
But she received my dog?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
<br />
back again.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
What, didst thou offer her this from me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LAUNCE</b>
Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
<br />
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
<br />
offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
<br />
yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
<br />
Or ne'er return again into my sight.
<br />
Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit LAUNCE</i><br />
A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
<br />
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
<br />
Partly that I have need of such a youth
<br />
That can with some discretion do my business,
<br />
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
<br />
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
<br />
Which, if my augury deceive me not,
<br />
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
<br />
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
<br />
Go presently and take this ring with thee,
<br />
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
<br />
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
<br />
She is dead, belike?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Not so; I think she lives.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Alas!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
I cannot choose
<br />
But pity her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Because methinks that she loved you as well
<br />
As you do love your lady Silvia:
<br />
She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
<br />
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
<br />
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
<br />
And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Well, give her that ring and therewithal
<br />
This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
<br />
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
<br />
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
<br />
Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
How many women would do such a message?
<br />
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
<br />
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
<br />
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
<br />
That with his very heart despiseth me?
<br />
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
<br />
Because I love him I must pity him.
<br />
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
<br />
To bind him to remember my good will;
<br />
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
<br />
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
<br />
To carry that which I would have refused,
<br />
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
<br />
I am my master's true-confirmed love;
<br />
But cannot be true servant to my master,
<br />
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
<br />
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
<br />
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter SILVIA, attended</i><br />
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
<br />
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
What would you with her, if that I be she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
If you be she, I do entreat your patience
<br />
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
From whom?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
O, he sends you for a picture.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Ay, madam.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Ursula, bring my picture here.
<br />
Go give your master this: tell him from me,
<br />
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
<br />
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
<br />
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
<br />
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
<br />
This is the letter to your ladyship.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
I pray thee, let me look on that again.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
There, hold!
<br />
I will not look upon your master's lines:
<br />
I know they are stuff'd with protestations
<br />
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
<br />
As easily as I do tear his paper.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
The more shame for him that he sends it me;
<br />
For I have heard him say a thousand times
<br />
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
<br />
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
<br />
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
She thanks you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
What say'st thou?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
<br />
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Dost thou know her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Almost as well as I do know myself:
<br />
To think upon her woes I do protest
<br />
That I have wept a hundred several times.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Is she not passing fair?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
<br />
When she did think my master loved her well,
<br />
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
<br />
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
<br />
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
<br />
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
<br />
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
<br />
That now she is become as black as I.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
How tall was she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
About my stature; for at Pentecost,
<br />
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
<br />
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
<br />
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
<br />
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
<br />
As if the garment had been made for me:
<br />
Therefore I know she is about my height.
<br />
And at that time I made her weep agood,
<br />
For I did play a lamentable part:
<br />
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
<br />
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
<br />
Which I so lively acted with my tears
<br />
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
<br />
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
<br />
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
<br />
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
<br />
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
<br />
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
<br />
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
<br />
Farewell.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit SILVIA, with attendants</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
<br />
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
<br />
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
<br />
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
<br />
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
<br />
Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
<br />
If I had such a tire, this face of mine
<br />
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
<br />
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
<br />
Unless I flatter with myself too much.
<br />
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
<br />
If that be all the difference in his love,
<br />
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
<br />
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
<br />
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
<br />
What should it be that he respects in her
<br />
But I can make respective in myself,
<br />
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
<br />
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
<br />
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
<br />
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
<br />
And, were there sense in his idolatry,
<br />
My substance should be statue in thy stead.
<br />
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
<br />
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
<br />
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
<br />
To make my master out of love with thee!

The sun begins to gild the western sky;

Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

O, sir, I find her milder than she was;

What, that my leg is too long?

No; that it is too little.

Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.

'Tis true; such pearls as put out

O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

Neither.

<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Why then,
<br />
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
<br />
And Eglamour is in her company.
<br />
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
<br />
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
<br />
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
<br />
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
<br />
Besides, she did intend confession
<br />
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
<br />
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
<br />
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
<br />
But mount you presently and meet with me
<br />
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
<br />
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:

Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

How use doth breed a habit in a man!
<br />
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
<br />
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
<br />
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
<br />
And to the nightingale's complaining notes
<br />
Tune my distresses and record my woes.
<br />
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
<br />
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
<br />
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
<br />
And leave no memory of what it was!
<br />
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
<br />
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
<br />
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
<br />
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
<br />
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
<br />
They love me well; yet I have much to do
<br />
To keep them from uncivil outrages.
<br />
Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA</p>

<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Madam, this service I have done for you,
<br />
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
<br />
To hazard life and rescue you from him
<br />
That would have forced your honour and your love;
<br />
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
<br />
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
<br />
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.

But by my coming I have made you happy.

By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
<br />
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
<br />
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
<br />
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
<br />
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
<br />
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
<br />
I do detest false perjured Proteus.
<br />
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
<br />
Would I not undergo for one calm look!
<br />
O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
<br />
When women cannot love where they're beloved!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
<br />
Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
<br />
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
<br />
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
<br />
Descended into perjury, to love me.
<br />
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
<br />
And that's far worse than none; better have none
<br />
Than plural faith which is too much by one:
<br />
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
In love
<br />
Who respects friend?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
All men but Proteus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
<br />
Can no way change you to a milder form,
<br />
I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
<br />
And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SILVIA</b>
O heaven!

<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
I'll force thee yield to my desire.

<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
<br />
Thou friend of an ill fashion!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Valentine!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
<br />
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
<br />
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
<br />
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
<br />
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
<br />
Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
<br />
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
<br />
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
<br />
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
<br />
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
<br />
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
My shame and guilt confounds me.
<br />
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
<br />
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
<br />
I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
<br />
As e'er I did commit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Then I am paid;
<br />
And once again I do receive thee honest.
<br />
Who by repentance is not satisfied
<br />
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
<br />
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
<br />
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
<br />
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
O me unhappy!

Look up; speak.

O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
<br />
to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Where is that ring, boy?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Here 'tis; this is it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
How! let me see:
<br />
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
<br />
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
<br />
I gave this unto Julia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
And Julia herself did give it me;
<br />
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
How! Julia!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JULIA</b>
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
<br />
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
<br />
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
<br />
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
<br />
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
<br />
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
<br />
In a disguise of love:
<br />
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
<br />
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Than men their minds! 'tis true.
<br />
O heaven! were man
<br />
But constant, he were perfect. That one error
<br />
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
<br />
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
<br />
What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
<br />
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Come, come, a hand from either:
<br />
Let me be blest to make this happy close;
<br />
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.

<p class="stagedir">Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Outlaws</b>
A prize, a prize, a prize!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
<br />
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
<br />
Banished Valentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Sir Valentine!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
<br />
Come not within the measure of my wrath;
<br />
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
<br />
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
<br />
Take but possession of her with a touch:
<br />
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THURIO</b>
Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
<br />
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
<br />
His body for a girl that loves him not:
<br />
I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
The more degenerate and base art thou,
<br />
To make such means for her as thou hast done
<br />
And leave her on such slight conditions.
<br />
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
<br />
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
<br />
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
<br />
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
<br />
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
<br />
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
<br />
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
<br />
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
<br />
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
<br />
I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
<br />
To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
These banish'd men that I have kept withal
<br />
Are men endued with worthy qualities:
<br />
Forgive them what they have committed here
<br />
And let them be recall'd from their exile:
<br />
They are reformed, civil, full of good
<br />
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
<br />
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
<br />
Come, let us go: we will include all jars
<br />
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
<br />
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
<br />
What think you of this page, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE</b>
What mean you by that saying?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
<br />
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
<br />
Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
<br />
The story of your loves discovered:
<br />
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
<br />
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
<br />
