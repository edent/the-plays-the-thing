Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
I rather would entreat thy company
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
Even as I would when I to love begin.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
If ever danger do environ thee,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
And on a love-book pray for my success?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
That's on some shallow story of deep love:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
That's a deep story of a deeper love:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
For he was more than over shoes in love.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
What?
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
However, but a folly bought with wit,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
Love is your master, for he masters you:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
And writers say, as the most forward bud
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
Even so by love the young and tender wit
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
Losing his verdure even in the prime
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
That art a votary to fond desire?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
Once more adieu! my father at the road
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-73">
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
</span>

<p>
<b class="speaker">PROTEUS</b>

Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
</span>

Of thy success in love, and what news else

Betideth here in absence of thy friend;

All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!

Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,

Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,

War with good counsel, set the world at nought;

Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?

But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.

Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,

And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.

Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,

An if the shepherd be a while away.

You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,

Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.

A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.

This proves me still a sheep.

True; and thy master a shepherd.

Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.

The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the

The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the

Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,

a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a

You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask

me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'

Now you have taken the pains to set it together,

take it for your pains.

No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.

Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,

not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:

When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,

look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a

<span class="line" id="3-3-5">
puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-3-6">
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-3-7">
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-3-8">
'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver

him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;

steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:

<span class="line" id="3-3-12">
O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself

in all companies! I would have, as one should say,

one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,

I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I

live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He

<span class="line" id="3-3-19">
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four

gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had

<span class="line" id="3-3-21">
not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-3-22">
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-3-23">
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him

out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.

I, having been acquainted with the smell before,

knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
