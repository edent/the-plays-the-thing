Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of
France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of
WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, &c</p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BEDFORD</b>
                     Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!                <br />
                     Comets, importing change of times and states,                <br />
                     Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,                <br />
                     And with them scourge the bad revolting stars                <br />
                     That have consented unto Henry's death!                <br />
                     King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!                <br />
                     England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     England ne'er had a king until his time.                <br />
                     Virtue he had, deserving to command:                <br />
                     His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:                <br />
                     His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;                <br />
                     His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,                <br />
                     More dazzled and drove back his enemies                <br />
                     Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.                <br />
                     What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:                <br />
                     He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
                     We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?                <br />
                     Henry is dead and never shall revive:                <br />
                     Upon a wooden coffin we attend,                <br />
                     And death's dishonourable victory                <br />
                     We with our stately presence glorify,                <br />
                     Like captives bound to a triumphant car.                <br />
                     What! shall we curse the planets of mishap                <br />
                     That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?                <br />
                     Or shall we think the subtle-witted French                <br />
                     Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him                <br />
                     By magic verses have contrived his end?                <br />

            <b class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</b>
                     He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.                <br />
                     Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day                <br />
                     So dreadful will not be as was his sight.                <br />
                     The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:                <br />
                     The church's prayers made him so prosperous.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,                <br />
                     His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:                <br />
                     None do you like but an effeminate prince,                <br />
                     Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</b>
                     Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector                <br />
                     And lookest to command the prince and realm.                <br />
                     Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,                <br />
                     More than God or religious churchmen may.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,                <br />
                     And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st                <br />
                     Except it be to pray against thy foes.                <br />

                     Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:                <br />
                     Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:                <br />
                     Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:                <br />
                     Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.                <br />
                     Posterity, await for wretched years,                <br />
                     When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,                <br />
                     Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,                <br />
                     And none but women left to wail the dead.                <br />
                     Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:                <br />
                     Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,                <br />
                     Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!                <br />
                     A far more glorious star thy soul will make                <br />
                     Than Julius Caesar or bright--                <br />

                     My honourable lords, health to you all!                <br />
                     Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,                <br />
                     Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:                <br />
                     Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,                <br />
                     Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BEDFORD</b>
                     What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?                <br />
                     Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns                <br />
                     Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?                <br />
                     If Henry were recall'd to life again,                <br />
                     These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
                     How were they lost? what treachery was used?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
                     No treachery; but want of men and money.                <br />
                     Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,                <br />
                     That here you maintain several factions,                <br />
                     And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,                <br />
                     You are disputing of your generals:                <br />
                     One would have lingering wars with little cost;                <br />
                     Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;                <br />
                     A third thinks, without expense at all,                <br />
                     By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.                <br />
                     Awake, awake, English nobility!                <br />
                     Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:                <br />
                     Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;                <br />
                     Of England's coat one half is cut away.                <br />

                     Were our tears wanting to this funeral,                <br />

                     Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.                <br />
                     France is revolted from the English quite,                <br />
                     Except some petty towns of no import:                <br />
                     The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;                <br />
                     The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;                <br />
                     Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;                <br />
                     The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.                <br />

                     The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!                <br />

                     My gracious lords, to add to your laments,                <br />
                     Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,                <br />
                     I must inform you of a dismal fight                <br />
                     Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</b>
                     What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>

                     O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:                <br />
                     The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.                <br />
                     The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,                <br />
                     Retiring from the siege of Orleans,                <br />
                     Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.                <br />
                     By three and twenty thousand of the French                <br />
                     Was round encompassed and set upon.                <br />
                     No leisure had he to enrank his men;                <br />
                     He wanted pikes to set before his archers;                <br />
                     Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges                <br />
                     They pitched in the ground confusedly,                <br />
                     To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.                <br />
                     More than three hours the fight continued;                <br />
                     Where valiant Talbot above human thought                <br />
                     Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:                <br />
                     Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;                <br />
                     Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:                <br />
                     The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;                <br />
                     All the whole army stood agazed on him:                <br />
                     His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit                <br />
                     A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain                <br />
                     And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.                <br />
                     Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,                <br />
                     If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:                <br />
                     He, being in the vaward, placed behind                <br />

                     With those clear rays which she infused on me                <br />
                     That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.                <br />
                     Ask me what question thou canst possible,                <br />
                     And I will answer unpremeditated:                <br />
                     My courage try by combat, if thou darest,                <br />
                     And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.                <br />
                     Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,                <br />

                     Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;                <br />
                     For him was I exchanged and ransomed.                <br />
                     But with a baser man of arms by far                <br />
                     Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:                <br />
                     Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,                <br />
                     Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.                <br />
                     In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.                <br />
                     But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,                <br />
                     Whom with my bare fists I would execute,                <br />

                     To be a public spectacle to all:                <br />
                     Here, said they, is the terror of the French,                <br />

                     And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,                <br />
                     To hurl at the beholders of my shame:                <br />
                     My grisly countenance made others fly;                <br />
                     None durst come near for fear of sudden death.                <br />
                     In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;                <br />
                     So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,                <br />
                     That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,                <br />
                     And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:                <br />
                     Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,                <br />
                     That walked about me every minute-while;                <br />
                     And if I did but stir out of my bed,                <br />
                     Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.                <br />

                     Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand                <br />
                     That hath contrived this woful tragedy!                <br />
                     In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;                <br />
                     Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;                <br />
                     Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,                <br />
                     His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.                <br />
                     Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,                <br />
                     One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:                <br />
                     The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.                <br />
                     Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,                <br />
                     If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!                <br />
                     Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.                <br />
                     Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?                <br />
                     Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.                <br />
                     Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;                <br />
                     Thou shalt not die whiles--                <br />
                     He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.                <br />
                     As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,                <br />
                     Remember to avenge me on the French.'                <br />
                     Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,                <br />
                     Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:                <br />
                     Wretched shall France be only in my name.                <br />

                     That droops his sapless branches to the ground;                <br />
                     Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,                <br />
                     Unable to support this lump of clay,                <br />
                     Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,                <br />
                     As witting I no other comfort have.                <br />
                     But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?                <br />

                     Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.                <br />
                     Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,                <br />
                     Before whose glory I was great in arms,                <br />
                     This loathsome sequestration have I had:                <br />
                     And even since then hath Richard been obscured,                <br />
                     Deprived of honour and inheritance.                <br />
                     But now the arbitrator of despairs,                <br />
                     Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,                <br />
                     With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:                <br />
                     I would his troubles likewise were expired,                <br />
                     That so he might recover what was lost.                <br />

                     First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;                <br />
                     And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.                <br />
                     This day, in argument upon a case,                <br />
                     Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;                <br />
                     Among which terms he used his lavish tongue                <br />
                     And did upbraid me with my father's death:                <br />
                     Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,                <br />
                     Else with the like I had requited him.                <br />
                     Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,                <br />
                     In honour of a true Plantagenet                <br />

                     I will, if that my fading breath permit                <br />
                     And death approach not ere my tale be done.                <br />
                     Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,                <br />
                     Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,                <br />
                     The first-begotten and the lawful heir,                <br />
                     Of Edward king, the third of that descent:                <br />
                     During whose reign the Percies of the north,                <br />
                     Finding his usurpation most unjust,                <br />
                     Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:                <br />
                     The reason moved these warlike lords to this                <br />
                     Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,                <br />
                     Leaving no heir begotten of his body--                <br />
                     I was the next by birth and parentage;                <br />
                     For by my mother I derived am                <br />
                     From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son                <br />
                     To King Edward the Third; whereas he                <br />
                     From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,                <br />
                     Being but fourth of that heroic line.                <br />
                     But mark: as in this haughty attempt                <br />
                     They laboured to plant the rightful heir,                <br />
                     I lost my liberty and they their lives.                <br />
                     Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,                <br />
                     Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,                <br />
                     Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived                <br />
                     From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,                <br />
                     Marrying my sister that thy mother was,                <br />
                     Again in pity of my hard distress                <br />
                     Levied an army, weening to redeem                <br />
                     And have install'd me in the diadem:                <br />
                     But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl                <br />
                     And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,                <br />
                     In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.                <br />

                     A man of thy profession and degree;                <br />
                     And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?                <br />
                     In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,                <br />
                     As well at London bridge as at the Tower.                <br />
                     Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,                <br />
                     The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt                <br />
                     From envious malice of thy swelling heart.                <br />

                     Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe                <br />
                     To give me hearing what I shall reply.                <br />
                     If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,                <br />
                     As he will have me, how am I so poor?                <br />
                     Or how haps it I seek not to advance                <br />
                     Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?                <br />
                     And for dissension, who preferreth peace                <br />
                     More than I do?--except I be provoked.                <br />
                     No, my good lords, it is not that offends;                <br />
                     It is not that that hath incensed the duke:                <br />
                     It is, because no one should sway but he;                <br />
                     No one but he should be about the king;                <br />
                     And that engenders thunder in his breast                <br />
                     And makes him roar these accusations forth.                <br />
                     But he shall know I am as good--                <br />

                     The presence of a king engenders love                <br />

                     Not seeing what is likely to ensue.                <br />
                     This late dissension grown betwixt the peers                <br />
                     Burns under feigned ashes of forged love                <br />
                     And will at last break out into a flame:                <br />
                     As fester'd members rot but by degree,                <br />

                     So will this base and envious discord breed.                <br />
                     And now I fear that fatal prophecy                <br />
                     Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth                <br />
                     Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;                <br />
                     That Henry born at Monmouth should win all                <br />
                     And Henry born at Windsor lose all:                <br />
                     Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish                <br />
                     His days may finish ere that hapless time.                <br />

                     They set him free without his ransom paid,                <br />
                     In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.                <br />

                     To haste unto your coronation,                <br />
                     A letter was deliver'd to my hands,                <br />

                     Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!                <br />
                     I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,                <br />
                     To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,                <br />

                     This dastard, at the battle of Patay,                <br />
                     When but in all I was six thousand strong                <br />
                     And that the French were almost ten to one,                <br />
                     Before we met or that a stroke was given,                <br />
                     Like to a trusty squire did run away:                <br />
                     In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;                <br />
                     Myself and divers gentlemen beside                <br />
                     Were there surprised and taken prisoners.                <br />
                     Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;                <br />
                     Or whether that such cowards ought to wear                <br />

                     Knights of the garter were of noble birth,                <br />
                     Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,                <br />

                     But always resolute in most extremes.                <br />

                     Come hither, you that would be combatants:                <br />
                     Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,                <br />
                     Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.                <br />
                     And you, my lords, remember where we are,                <br />
                     In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:                <br />
                     If they perceive dissension in our looks                <br />
                     And that within ourselves we disagree,                <br />
                     How will their grudging stomachs be provoked                <br />
                     To wilful disobedience, and rebel!                <br />
                     Beside, what infamy will there arise,                <br />
                     When foreign princes shall be certified                <br />
                     That for a toy, a thing of no regard,                <br />
                     King Henry's peers and chief nobility                <br />
                     Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!                <br />
                     O, think upon the conquest of my father,                <br />
                     My tender years, and let us not forego                <br />
                     That for a trifle that was bought with blood                <br />
                     Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.                <br />
                     I see no reason, if I wear this rose,                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">Putting on a red rose</i><br />
                     That any one should therefore be suspicious                <br />
                     I more incline to Somerset than York:                <br />
                     Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:                <br />
                     As well they may upbraid me with my crown,                <br />
                     Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.                <br />
                     But your discretions better can persuade                <br />
                     Than I am able to instruct or teach:                <br />
                     And therefore, as we hither came in peace,                <br />
                     So let us still continue peace and love.                <br />
                     Cousin of York, we institute your grace                <br />
                     To be our regent in these parts of France:                <br />
                     And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite                <br />
                     Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;                <br />
                     And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,                <br />
                     Go cheerfully together and digest.                <br />
                     Your angry choler on your enemies.                <br />
                     Ourself, my lord protector and the rest                <br />
                     After some respite will return to Calais;                <br />
                     From thence to England; where I hope ere long                <br />
                     To be presented, by your victories,                <br />
                     With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.                <br />

                     Servant in arms to Harry King of England;                <br />

                     Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,                <br />

                     And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:                <br />
                     But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,                <br />
                     You tempt the fury of my three attendants,                <br />

                     Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,                <br />
                     Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!                <br />
                     The period of thy tyranny approacheth.                <br />
                     On us thou canst not enter but by death;                <br />
                     For, I protest, we are well fortified                <br />
                     And strong enough to issue out and fight:                <br />
                     If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,                <br />
                     Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:                <br />
                     On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,                <br />
                     To wall thee from the liberty of flight;                <br />
                     And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,                <br />
                     But death doth front thee with apparent spoil                <br />
                     And pale destruction meets thee in the face.                <br />
                     Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament                <br />
                     To rive their dangerous artillery                <br />
                     Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.                <br />
                     Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,                <br />
                     Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!                <br />
                     This is the latest glory of thy praise                <br />
                     That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;                <br />

                     Finish the process of his sandy hour,                <br />
                     These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,                <br />
                     Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.                <br />

                     If we be English deer, be then in blood;                <br />
                     Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,                <br />

                     And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:                <br />
                     Sell every man his life as dear as mine,                <br />

                     So should we save a valiant gentleman                <br />
                     By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.                <br />
                     Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,                <br />
                     That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.                <br />

                     Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,                <br />
                     Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,                <br />
                     Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,                <br />
                     And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.                <br />

                     From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood                <br />
                     Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,                <br />
                     And interchanging blows I quickly shed                <br />
                     Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace                <br />
                     Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base                <br />

                     Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,                <br />
                     Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,                <br />
                     Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?                <br />
                     Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,                <br />
                     Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?                <br />

                     The help of one stands me in little stead.                <br />
                     O, too much folly is it, well I wot,                <br />

                     To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:                <br />

                     'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:                <br />

                     Out of the powerful regions under earth,                <br />
                     Help me this once, that France may get the field.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">They walk, and speak not</i><br />
                     O, hold me not with silence over-long!                <br />
                     Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,                <br />
                     I'll lop a member off and give it you                <br />
                     In earnest of further benefit,                <br />
                     So you do condescend to help me now.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">They hang their heads</i><br />
                     No hope to have redress? My body shall                <br />
                     Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">They shake their heads</i><br />
                     Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice                <br />
                     Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?                <br />
                     Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,                <br />
                     Before that England give the French the foil.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">They depart</i><br />
                     See, they forsake me! Now the time is come                <br />
                     That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest                <br />
                     And let her head fall into England's lap.                <br />
                     My ancient incantations are too weak,                <br />
                     And hell too strong for me to buckle with:                <br />
                     Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.                <br />
                     Be not offended, nature's miracle,                <br />
                     Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:                <br />
                     So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,                <br />
                     Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.                <br />
                     Yet, if this servile usage once offend.                <br />
                     Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">She is going</i><br />
                     O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;                <br />
                     My hand would free her, but my heart says no                <br />
                     As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,                <br />
                     Twinkling another counterfeited beam,                <br />
                     So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.                <br />
                     Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:                <br />
                     I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.                <br />
                     Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;                <br />
                     Hast not a tongue? is she not here?                <br />
                     Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?                <br />
                     Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,                <br />
                     Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MARGARET</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;                <br />
                     She is a woman, therefore to be won.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARGARET</b>
                     Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.                <br />

                     I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>

            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?                <br />
                     Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARGARET</b>
                     He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,                <br />
                     And peace established between these realms                <br />
                     But there remains a scruple in that too;                <br />
                     For though her father be the King of Naples,                <br />
                     Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,                <br />
                     And our nobility will scorn the match.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARGARET</b>

                     Madam, I have a secret to reveal.                <br />

                     Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARGARET</b>
                     To be a queen in bondage is more vile                <br />
                     Than is a slave in base servility;                <br />
                     For princes should be free.                <br />

                     But you, that are polluted with your lusts,                <br />
                     Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,                <br />
                     Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,                <br />
                     Because you want the grace that others have,                <br />
                     You judge it straight a thing impossible                <br />
                     To compass wonders but by help of devils.                <br />
                     No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been                <br />
                     A virgin from her tender infancy,                <br />
                     Chaste and immaculate in very thought;                <br />

                     Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,                <br />
                     For here we entertain a solemn peace.                <br />

GLOUCESTER and EXETER</p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,                <br />
                     Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:                <br />
                     Her virtues graced with external gifts                <br />
                     Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:                <br />
                     And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts                <br />
                     Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,                <br />
                     So am I driven by breath of her renown                <br />
                     Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive                <br />
                     Where I may have fruition of her love.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale                <br />
                     Is but a preface of her worthy praise;                <br />
                     The chief perfections of that lovely dame                <br />
                     Had I sufficient skill to utter them,                <br />
                     Would make a volume of enticing lines,                <br />
                     Able to ravish any dull conceit:                <br />
                     And, which is more, she is not so divine,                <br />
                     So full-replete with choice of all delights,                <br />
                     But with as humble lowliness of mind                <br />
                     She is content to be at your command;                <br />
                     Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,                <br />
                     To love and honour Henry as her lord.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.                <br />
                     Therefore, my lord protector, give consent                <br />
                     That Margaret may be England's royal queen.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     So should I give consent to flatter sin.                <br />
                     You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd                <br />
                     Unto another lady of esteem:                <br />
                     How shall we then dispense with that contract,                <br />
                     And not deface your honour with reproach?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;                <br />
                     Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd                <br />
                     To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists                <br />
                     By reason of his adversary's odds:                <br />
                     A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,                <br />
                     And therefore may be broke without offence.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?                <br />
                     Her father is no better than an earl,                <br />
                     Although in glorious titles he excel.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     Yes, lord, her father is a king,                <br />
                     The King of Naples and Jerusalem;                <br />
                     And of such great authority in France                <br />
                     As his alliance will confirm our peace                <br />
                     And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
                     And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,                <br />
                     Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
                     Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,                <br />
                     Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
                     A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,                <br />
                     That he should be so abject, base and poor,                <br />
                     To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.                <br />
                     Henry is able to enrich his queen                <br />
                     And not seek a queen to make him rich:                <br />
                     So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,                <br />
                     As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.                <br />
                     Marriage is a matter of more worth                <br />
                     Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;                <br />
                     Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,                <br />
                     Must be companion of his nuptial bed:                <br />
                     And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,                <br />
                     It most of all these reasons bindeth us,                <br />
                     In our opinions she should be preferr'd.                <br />
                     For what is wedlock forced but a hell,                <br />
                     An age of discord and continual strife?                <br />
                     Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,                <br />
                     And is a pattern of celestial peace.                <br />
                     Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,                <br />
                     But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?                <br />
                     Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,                <br />
                     Approves her fit for none but for a king:                <br />
                     Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,                <br />
                     More than in women commonly is seen,                <br />
                     Will answer our hope in issue of a king;                <br />
                     For Henry, son unto a conqueror,                <br />
                     Is likely to beget more conquerors,                <br />
                     If with a lady of so high resolve                <br />
                     As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.                <br />
                     Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me                <br />
                     That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.                <br />

                     Whether it be through force of your report,                <br />
                     My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that                <br />
                     My tender youth was never yet attaint                <br />
                     With any passion of inflaming love,                <br />
                     I cannot tell; but this I am assured,                <br />
                     I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,                <br />
                     Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,                <br />
                     As I am sick with working of my thoughts.                <br />
                     Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;                <br />
                     Agree to any covenants, and procure                <br />
                     That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come                <br />
                     To cross the seas to England and be crown'd                <br />
                     King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:                <br />
                     For your expenses and sufficient charge,                <br />
                     Among the people gather up a tenth.                <br />
                     Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,                <br />
                     I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.                <br />
                     And you, good uncle, banish all offence:                <br />
                     If you do censure me by what you were,                <br />
                     Not what you are, I know it will excuse                <br />
                     This sudden execution of my will.                <br />
                     And so, conduct me where, from company,                <br />
                     I may revolve and ruminate my grief.                <br />
