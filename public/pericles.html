<p class="stagedir">Before the palace of Antioch</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">[GOWER]</b>
To sing a song that old was sung,
<br />
From ashes ancient Gower is come;
<br />
Assuming man's infirmities,
<br />
To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
<br />
It hath been sung at festivals,
<br />
On ember-eves and holy-ales;
<br />
And lords and ladies in their lives
<br />
Have read it for restoratives:
<br />
The purchase is to make men glorious;
<br />
Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
<br />
If you, born in these latter times,
<br />
When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.
<br />
And that to hear an old man sing
<br />
May to your wishes pleasure bring
<br />
I life would wish, and that I might
<br />
Waste it for you, like taper-light.
<br />
This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
<br />
Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
<br />
The fairest in all Syria,
<br />
I tell you what mine authors say:
<br />
This king unto him took a fere,
<br />
Who died and left a female heir,
<br />
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
<br />
As heaven had lent her all his grace;
<br />
With whom the father liking took,
<br />
And her to incest did provoke:
<br />
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
<br />
To evil should be done by none:
<br />
But custom what they did begin
<br />
Was with long use account no sin.
<br />
The beauty of this sinful dame
<br />
Made many princes thither frame,
<br />
To seek her as a bed-fellow,
<br />
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
<br />
Which to prevent he made a law,
<br />
To keep her still, and men in awe,
<br />
That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
<br />
His riddle told not, lost his life:
<br />
So for her many a wight did die,
<br />
As yon grim looks do testify.
<br />
What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
<br />
I give, my cause who best can justify.

<h3>SCENE I.  Antioch. A room in the palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
<br />
The danger of the task you undertake.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
<br />
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
<br />
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
<br />
For the embracements even of Jove himself;
<br />
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
<br />
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
<br />
The senate-house of planets all did sit,
<br />
To knit in her their best perfections.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
<br />
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
<br />
Of every virtue gives renown to men!
<br />
Her face the book of praises, where is read
<br />
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
<br />
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
<br />
Could never be her mild companion.
<br />
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
<br />
That have inflamed desire in my breast
<br />
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
<br />
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
<br />
As I am son and servant to your will,
<br />
To compass such a boundless happiness!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Prince Pericles,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
That would be son to great Antiochus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
<br />
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
<br />
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
<br />
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
<br />
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
<br />
And which, without desert, because thine eye
<br />
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
<br />
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
<br />
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
<br />
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
<br />
That without covering, save yon field of stars,
<br />
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
<br />
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
<br />
For going on death's net, whom none resist.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
<br />
My frail mortality to know itself,
<br />
And by those fearful objects to prepare
<br />
This body, like to them, to what I must;
<br />
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
<br />
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
<br />
I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
<br />
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
<br />
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
<br />
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
<br />
And all good men, as every prince should do;
<br />
My riches to the earth from whence they came;
<br />
But my unspotted fire of love to you.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</i><br />
Thus ready for the way of life or death,
<br />
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
<br />
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
<br />
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Daughter</b>
Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
<br />
Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
<br />
Nor ask advice of any other thought
<br />
But faithfulness and courage.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">He reads the riddle</i><br />
I am no viper, yet I feed
<br />
On mother's flesh which did me breed.
<br />
I sought a husband, in which labour
<br />
I found that kindness in a father:
<br />
He's father, son, and husband mild;
<br />
I mother, wife, and yet his child.
<br />
How they may be, and yet in two,
<br />
As you will live, resolve it you.
<br />
Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
<br />
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
<br />
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
<br />
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
<br />
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</i><br />
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
<br />
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
<br />
For he's no man on whom perfections wait
<br />
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
<br />
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
<br />
Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
<br />
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:
<br />
But being play'd upon before your time,
<br />
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
<br />
Good sooth, I care not for you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
<br />
For that's an article within our law,
<br />
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
<br />
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Great king,
<br />
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
<br />
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
<br />
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
<br />
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
<br />
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
<br />
Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;
<br />
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
<br />
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
<br />
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
<br />
Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
<br />
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
<br />
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
<br />
their will;
<br />
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
<br />
It is enough you know; and it is fit,
<br />
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
<br />
All love the womb that their first being bred,
<br />
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
<br />
the meaning:
<br />
But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
<br />
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
<br />
Your exposition misinterpreting,
<br />
We might proceed to cancel of your days;
<br />
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
<br />
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
<br />
Forty days longer we do respite you;
<br />
If by which time our secret be undone,
<br />
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
<br />
And until then your entertain shall be
<br />
As doth befit our honour and your worth.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt all but PERICLES</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
<br />
When what is done is like an hypocrite,
<br />
The which is good in nothing but in sight!
<br />
If it be true that I interpret false,
<br />
Then were it certain you were not so bad
<br />
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
<br />
Where now you're both a father and a son,
<br />
By your untimely claspings with your child,
<br />
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
<br />
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
<br />
By the defiling of her parent's bed;
<br />
And both like serpents are, who though they feed
<br />
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
<br />
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
<br />
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
<br />
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
<br />
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
<br />
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
<br />
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
<br />
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
<br />
Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
<br />
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter ANTIOCHUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
<br />
To have his head.
<br />
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
<br />
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
<br />
In such a loathed manner;
<br />
And therefore instantly this prince must die:
<br />
For by his fall my honour must keep high.
<br />
Who attends us there?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter THALIARD</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THALIARD</b>
Doth your highness call?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</b>
Thaliard,
<br />
You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
<br />
Her private actions to your secrecy;
<br />
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
<br />
Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
<br />
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
<br />
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
<br />
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THALIARD</b>
My lord,
<br />
'Tis done.

If I can get him within my pistol's length,
<br />
I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.

<h3>SCENE II.  Tyre. A room in the palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter PERICLES</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
<i class="parenthetical">To Lords without</i>
Let none disturb us.--Why should
<br />
this change of thoughts,
<br />
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
<br />
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
<br />
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
<br />
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
<br />
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
<br />
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
<br />
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
<br />
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
<br />
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
<br />
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
<br />
That have their first conception by mis-dread,
<br />
Have after-nourishment and life by care;
<br />
And what was first but fear what might be done,
<br />
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
<br />
And so with me: the great Antiochus,
<br />
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
<br />
Since he's so great can make his will his act,
<br />
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
<br />
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
<br />
If he suspect I may dishonour him:
<br />
And what may make him blush in being known,
<br />
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
<br />
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
<br />
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
<br />
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
<br />
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
<br />
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
<br />
Which care of them, not pity of myself,
<br />
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
<br />
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
<br />
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
<br />
And punish that before that he would punish.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords</p>

<b class="speaker">First Lord</b>
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!

<br />
Peaceful and comfortable!

Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
<br />
They do abuse the king that flatter him:
<br />
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
<br />
The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
<br />
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
<br />
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
<br />
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
<br />
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
<br />
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
<br />
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
<br />
I cannot be much lower than my knees.

<br />

<br />
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
<br />
What wouldst thou have me do?
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
To bear with patience
<br />
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
<br />
That minister'st a potion unto me
<br />
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
<br />
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
<br />
Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
<br />
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
<br />
From whence an issue I might propagate,
<br />
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
<br />
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
<br />
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
<br />
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
<br />
Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
<br />
know'st this,
<br />
'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
<br />
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
<br />
Under the covering of a careful night,
<br />
Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
<br />
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
<br />
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
<br />
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
<br />
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
<br />
That I should open to the listening air
<br />
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
<br />
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
<br />
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
<br />
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
<br />
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
<br />
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
<br />
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
<br />
Who now reprovest me for it,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Alas, sir!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
<br />
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
<br />
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
<br />
And finding little comfort to relieve them,
<br />
I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
<br />
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
<br />
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
<br />
Who either by public war or private treason
<br />
Will take away your life.
<br />
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
<br />
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
<br />
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
<br />
Your rule direct to any; if to me.
<br />
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.

From whence we had our being and our birth.

Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
<br />
Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;

And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
<br />
The care I had and have of subjects' good
<br />
On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
<br />
I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:

Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:

But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,

he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,

<h3>SCENE IV.  Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA,
and others</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
<br />
And by relating tales of others' griefs,
<br />
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
<br />
For who digs hills because they do aspire
<br />
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
<br />
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
<br />
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
<br />
But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
O Dionyza,
<br />
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
<br />
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
<br />
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
<br />
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
<br />
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
<br />
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
<br />
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
<br />
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
<br />
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
I'll do my best, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
<br />
A city on whom plenty held full hand,
<br />
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
<br />
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
<br />
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
<br />
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
<br />
Like one another's glass to trim them by:
<br />
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
<br />
And not so much to feed on as delight;
<br />
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
<br />
The name of help grew odious to repeat.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
O, 'tis too true.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
<br />
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
<br />
Were all too little to content and please,
<br />
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
<br />
As houses are defiled for want of use,
<br />
They are now starved for want of exercise:
<br />
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
<br />
Must have inventions to delight the taste,
<br />
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
<br />
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
<br />
Thought nought too curious, are ready now
<br />
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
<br />
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
<br />
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
<br />
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
<br />
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
<br />
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
<br />
Is not this true?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
<br />
And her prosperities so largely taste,
<br />
With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
<br />
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.

Where's the lord governor?

Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,

For comfort is too far for us to expect.

We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,
<br />
A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
I thought as much.
<br />
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
<br />
That may succeed as his inheritor;
<br />
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
<br />
Taking advantage of our misery,
<br />
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
<br />
To beat us down, the which are down already;
<br />
And make a conquest of unhappy me,
<br />
Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord</b>
That's the least fear; for, by the semblance
<br />
Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
<br />
And come to us as favourers, not as foes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
<br />
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
<br />
But bring they what they will and what they can,
<br />
What need we fear?
<br />
The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
<br />
Go tell their general we attend him here,
<br />
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
<br />
And what he craves.

I go, my lord.

Lord governor, for so we hear you are,

We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,

Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,

The which when any shall not gratify,

Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that

were cast away before us even now.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Fisherman</b>
Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what

pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,

well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Fisherman</b>
Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the

porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say

they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,

they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I

marvel how the fishes live in the sea.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Fisherman</b>
Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the

little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
<br />
nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and
<br />
tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
<br />
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
<br />
have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping

steeple, bells, and all.

Why, man?

Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I

had been in his belly, I would have kept such a
<br />
jangling of the bells, that he should never have

left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and

An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.

Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,

Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
<br />
And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
<br />
Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
<br />
With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
<br />
'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
<br />
Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--
<br />
'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--
<br />
The which the gods protect thee from!--may
<br />
defend thee.'
<br />
It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;
<br />
Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
<br />
Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:
<br />
I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
<br />
Since I have here my father's gift in's will.

What mean you, sir?

<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
<br />
For it was sometime target to a king;
<br />
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
<br />
And for his sake I wish the having of it;
<br />
And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,
<br />
Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
<br />
And if that ever my low fortune's better,
<br />
I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.

Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up

this garment through the rough seams of the waters:

whence you had it.

Believe 't, I will.

By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;

And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,

This jewel holds his building on my arm:

Unto thy value I will mount myself
<br />
Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
<br />
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
<br />
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided

Of a pair of bases.

As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
<br />
So princes their renowns if not respected.
<br />
'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
<br />
The labour of each knight in his device.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire
presents his shield to the Princess</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
<br />
And the device he bears upon his shield
<br />
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
<br />
The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
He loves you well that holds his life of you.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">The Second Knight passes over</i><br />
Who is the second that presents himself?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
<br />
And the device he bears upon his shield
<br />
Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
<br />
The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">The Third Knight passes over</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
And what's the third?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
The third of Antioch;
<br />
And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
<br />
The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">The Fourth Knight passes over</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
What is the fourth?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
A burning torch that's turned upside down;
<br />
The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
<br />
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">The Fifth Knight passes over</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
<br />
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
<br />
The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
And what's
<br />
The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
<br />
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
<br />
A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
<br />
The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
A pretty moral;
<br />
From the dejected state wherein he is,
<br />
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Lord</b>
He had need mean better than his outward show
<br />
Can any way speak in his just commend;
<br />
For by his rusty outside he appears
<br />
To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Lord</b>
He well may be a stranger, for he comes
<br />
To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Lord</b>
And on set purpose let his armour rust
<br />
Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
<br />
The outward habit by the inward man.
<br />
But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw
<br />
Into the gallery.

<h3>SCENE III.  The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and
Knights, from tilting</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Knights,
<br />
To say you're welcome were superfluous.
<br />
To place upon the volume of your deeds,
<br />
As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
<br />
Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
<br />
Since every worth in show commends itself.
<br />
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
<br />
You are princes and my guests.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
But you, my knight and guest;
<br />
To whom this wreath of victory I give,
<br />
And crown you king of this day's happiness.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
<br />
And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
<br />
In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
<br />
To make some good, but others to exceed;
<br />
And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'
<br />
the feast,--
<br />
For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:
<br />
Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KNIGHTS</b>
We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Your presence glads our days: honour we love;
<br />
For who hates honour hates the gods above.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Marshal</b>
Sir, yonder is your place.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Some other is more fit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Knight</b>
Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen
<br />
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
<br />
Envy the great nor do the low despise.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
You are right courteous knights.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Sit, sir, sit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
<br />
These cates resist me, she but thought upon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
<br />
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
<br />
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
He's but a country gentleman;
<br />
Has done no more than other knights have done;
<br />
Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
To me he seems like diamond to glass.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
<br />
Which tells me in that glory once he was;
<br />
Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
<br />
And he the sun, for them to reverence;
<br />
None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
<br />
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
<br />
Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,
<br />
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:
<br />
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,
<br />
He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
<br />
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
What, are you merry, knights?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Knights</b>
Who can be other in this royal presence?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
<br />
As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
<br />
We drink this health to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KNIGHTS</b>
We thank your grace.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Yet pause awhile:
<br />
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
<br />
As if the entertainment in our court
<br />
Had not a show might countervail his worth.
<br />
Note it not you, Thaisa?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
What is it
<br />
To me, my father?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
O, attend, my daughter:
<br />
Princes in this should live like gods above,
<br />
Who freely give to every one that comes
<br />
To honour them:
<br />
And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
<br />
Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
<br />
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
<br />
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Alas, my father, it befits not me
<br />
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
<br />
He may my proffer take for an offence,
<br />
Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
How!
<br />
Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
<br />
Of whence he is, his name and parentage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I thank him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
And further he desires to know of you,
<br />
Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;
<br />
My education been in arts and arms;
<br />
Who, looking for adventures in the world,
<br />
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
<br />
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
<br />
A gentleman of Tyre,
<br />
Who only by misfortune of the seas
<br />
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
<br />
And will awake him from his melancholy.
<br />
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
<br />
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
<br />
Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
<br />
Will very well become a soldier's dance.
<br />
I will not have excuse, with saying this
<br />
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
<br />
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">The Knights dance</i><br />
So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
<br />
Come, sir;
<br />
Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
<br />
And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
<br />
Are excellent in making ladies trip;
<br />
And that their measures are as excellent.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
In those that practise them they are, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
O, that's as much as you would be denied
<br />
Of your fair courtesy.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">The Knights and Ladies dance</i><br />
Unclasp, unclasp:
<br />
Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To PERICLES</i><br />
But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
<br />
These knights unto their several lodgings!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To PERICLES</i><br />
Yours, sir,
<br />
We have given order to be next our own.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I am at your grace's pleasure.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIMONIDES</b>
Princes, it is too late to talk of love;
<br />
And that's the mark I know you level at:
<br />
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
<br />
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.

No, Escanes, know this of me,

Antiochus from incest lived not free:

For which, the most high gods not minding longer
<br />
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
<br />
Due to this heinous capital offence,
<br />
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
<br />
When he was seated in a chariot
<br />
Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
<br />
A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
<br />
Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
<br />
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
<br />
Scorn now their hand should give them burial.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ESCANES</b>
'Twas very strange.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
And yet but justice; for though

This king were great, his greatness was no guard

To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.

Know that our griefs are risen to the top,

And now at length they overflow their banks.

Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.

Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;
<br />
But if the prince do live, let us salute him,
<br />
Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
<br />
If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;
<br />
If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;

And be resolved he lives to govern us,

Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,

And leave us to our free election.

Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,

Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
<br />
A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to
<br />
Forbear the absence of your king:
<br />
If in which time expired, he not return,
<br />
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
<br />
But if I cannot win you to this love,
<br />
Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
<br />
And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
<br />
Whom if you find, and win unto return,
<br />
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.

<h3>[Prologue] </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter GOWER</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GOWER</b>
Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;
<br />
No din but snores the house about,
<br />
Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
<br />
Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
<br />
The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
<br />
Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;
<br />
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
<br />
E'er the blither for their drouth.
<br />
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.
<br />
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
<br />
A babe is moulded. Be attent,
<br />
And time that is so briefly spent
<br />
With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
<br />
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">DUMB SHOW.</i><br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with
Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and
gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it
SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter
THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The
KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and
PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with
LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt
SIMONIDES and the rest</i><br />
By many a dern and painful perch
<br />
Of Pericles the careful search,
<br />
By the four opposing coigns
<br />
Which the world together joins,
<br />
Is made with all due diligence
<br />
That horse and sail and high expense
<br />
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
<br />
Fame answering the most strange inquire,
<br />
To the court of King Simonides
<br />
Are letters brought, the tenor these:
<br />
Antiochus and his daughter dead;
<br />
The men of Tyrus on the head
<br />
Of Helicanus would set on
<br />
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
<br />
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
<br />
Says to 'em, if King Pericles
<br />
Come not home in twice six moons,
<br />
He, obedient to their dooms,
<br />
Will take the crown. The sum of this,
<br />
Brought hither to Pentapolis,
<br />
Y-ravished the regions round,
<br />
And every one with claps can sound,
<br />
'Our heir-apparent is a king!
<br />
Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
<br />
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
<br />
His queen with child makes her desire--
<br />
Which who shall cross?--along to go:
<br />
Omit we all their dole and woe:
<br />
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
<br />
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
<br />
On Neptune's billow; half the flood
<br />
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
<br />
Varies again; the grisly north
<br />
Disgorges such a tempest forth,
<br />
That, as a duck for life that dives,
<br />
So up and down the poor ship drives:
<br />
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
<br />
Does fall in travail with her fear:
<br />
And what ensues in this fell storm
<br />
Shall for itself itself perform.
<br />
I nill relate, action may
<br />
Conveniently the rest convey;
<br />
Which might not what by me is told.
<br />
In your imagination hold
<br />
This stage the ship, upon whose deck

The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.

Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench

Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,

How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;

Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle

Is as a whisper in the ears of death,

Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O

That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!

Thou hast as chiding a nativity

As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,

To herald thee from the womb: even at the first

I would it would be quiet.

Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,

the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be

No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements

Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time

To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
<br />
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
<br />
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,

And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
<br />
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
<br />
Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,
<br />
Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
<br />
My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
<br />
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
<br />
Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say

Good morrow to your lordship.

Gentlemen,
<br />
Why do you stir so early?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
Sir,
<br />
Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
<br />
Shook as the earth did quake;
<br />
The very principals did seem to rend,
<br />
And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear
<br />
Made me to quit the house.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
That is the cause we trouble you so early;
<br />
'Tis not our husbandry.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CERIMON</b>
O, you say well.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
But I much marvel that your lordship, having
<br />
Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
<br />
Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
<br />
'Tis most strange,
<br />
Nature should be so conversant with pain,
<br />
Being thereto not compell'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CERIMON</b>
I hold it ever,
<br />
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
<br />
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
<br />
May the two latter darken and expend;
<br />
But immortality attends the former.
<br />
Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
<br />
Have studied physic, through which secret art,
<br />
By turning o'er authorities, I have,
<br />
Together with my practise, made familiar
<br />
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
<br />
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
<br />
And I can speak of the disturbances
<br />
That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
<br />
A more content in course of true delight
<br />
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
<br />
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
<br />
To please the fool and death.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
<br />
Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
<br />
Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
<br />
And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
<br />
Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
<br />
Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.

'Tis of some wreck.

<p>
<b class="speaker">CERIMON</b>
Set 't down, let's look upon't.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
'Tis like a coffin, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CERIMON</b>
Whate'er it be,
<br />
'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:
<br />
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
<br />
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.

<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
'Tis so, my lord.

How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!

Did the sea cast it up?

Nay, certainly to-night;

<br />
In music, letters; who hath gain'd
<br />
Of education all the grace,
<br />
Which makes her both the heart and place
<br />
Of general wonder. But, alack,
<br />
That monster envy, oft the wrack
<br />
Of earned praise, Marina's life
<br />
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
<br />
And in this kind hath our Cleon
<br />
One daughter, and a wench full grown,
<br />
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
<br />
Hight Philoten: and it is said
<br />
For certain in our story, she
<br />
Would ever with Marina be:
<br />
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
<br />
With fingers long, small, white as milk;
<br />
Or when she would with sharp needle wound
<br />
The cambric, which she made more sound
<br />
By hurting it; or when to the lute
<br />
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
<br />
That still records with moan; or when
<br />
She would with rich and constant pen
<br />
Vail to her mistress Dian; still
<br />
This Philoten contends in skill
<br />
With absolute Marina: so
<br />
With the dove of Paphos might the crow
<br />
Vie feathers white. Marina gets
<br />
All praises, which are paid as debts,
<br />
And not as given. This so darks
<br />
In Philoten all graceful marks,
<br />
That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
<br />
A present murderer does prepare
<br />
For good Marina, that her daughter
<br />
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
<br />
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
<br />
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
<br />
And cursed Dionyza hath
<br />
The pregnant instrument of wrath
<br />
Prest for this blow. The unborn event
<br />
I do commend to your content:
<br />
Only I carry winged time
<br />
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
<br />
Which never could I so convey,
<br />
Unless your thoughts went on my way.
<br />
Dionyza does appear,
<br />
With Leonine, a murderer.

<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
<br />
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
<br />
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
<br />
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
<br />
Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
<br />
Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
<br />
Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
<br />
A soldier to thy purpose.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
<br />
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
<br />
Thou art resolved?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
I am resolved.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
<br />
To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
<br />
The purple violets, and marigolds,
<br />
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
<br />
While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
<br />
Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
<br />
This world to me is like a lasting storm,
<br />
Whirring me from my friends.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
<br />
How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
<br />
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
<br />
A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
<br />
With this unprofitable woe!
<br />
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
<br />
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
<br />
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
<br />
Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
No, I pray you;
<br />
I'll not bereave you of your servant.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
Come, come;
<br />
I love the king your father, and yourself,
<br />
With more than foreign heart. We every day
<br />
Expect him here: when he shall come and find
<br />
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
<br />
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
<br />
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
<br />
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
<br />
Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
<br />
That excellent complexion, which did steal
<br />
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
<br />
I can go home alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Well, I will go;
<br />
But yet I have no desire to it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
<br />
Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
<br />
Remember what I have said.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
I warrant you, madam.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:
<br />
Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
<br />
What! I must have a care of you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
My thanks, sweet madam.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit DIONYZA</i><br />
Is this wind westerly that blows?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
South-west.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
When I was born, the wind was north.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
Was't so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
<br />
But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling
<br />
His kingly hands, haling ropes;
<br />
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
<br />
That almost burst the deck.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
When was this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
When I was born:
<br />
Never was waves nor wind more violent;
<br />
And from the ladder-tackle washes off
<br />
A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
<br />
And with a dropping industry they skip
<br />
From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
<br />
The master calls, and trebles their confusion.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
Come, say your prayers.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
What mean you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
If you require a little space for prayer,
<br />
I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
<br />
For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
<br />
To do my work with haste.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Why will you kill me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
To satisfy my lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Why would she have me kill'd?
<br />
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
<br />
I never did her hurt in all my life:
<br />
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
<br />
To any living creature: believe me, la,
<br />
I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
<br />
I trod upon a worm against my will,
<br />
But I wept for it. How have I offended,
<br />
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
<br />
Or my life imply her any danger?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEONINE</b>
My commission
<br />
Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
<br />
You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
<br />
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
<br />
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
<br />
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
<br />
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
<br />
And save poor me, the weaker.

There's no hope she will return. I'll swear

she's dead,
<br />
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:

Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,

Sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Pandar</b>
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
<br />
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
<br />
too wenchless.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Bawd</b>
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
<br />
poor three, and they can do no more than they can
<br />
do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Pandar</b>
Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for
<br />
them. If there be not a conscience to be used in

every trade, we shall never prosper.

Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor

bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--

Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But

shall I search the market?

</p>

What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
<br />
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Pandar</b>
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'
<br />
conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that
<br />
lay with the little baggage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BOULT</b>
Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat

Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a

proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Bawd</b>
Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get
<br />
when we are old?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Pandar</b>
O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor
<br />
the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,
<br />
if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
<br />
estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.
<br />
Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
<br />
will be strong with us for giving over.

Come, other sorts offend as well as we.

Boult, has she any qualities?

Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
<br />
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
<br />
She did disdain my child, and stood between
<br />
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
<br />
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
<br />
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
<br />
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
<br />
And though you call my course unnatural,
<br />
You not your child well loving, yet I find
<br />
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
<br />
Perform'd to your sole daughter.

Heavens forgive it!

</p>
<p>

And as for Pericles,
<br />
What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
<br />
And yet we mourn: her monument
<br />
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
<br />
In glittering golden characters express
<br />
A general praise to her, and care in us
<br />
At whose expense 'tis done.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
Thou art like the harpy,

Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,

Seize with thine eagle's talons.

<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
You are like one that superstitiously

Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:

But yet I know you'll do as I advise.

<h3>SCENE IV </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GOWER</b>
Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
<br />
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;
<br />
Making, to take your imagination,
<br />
From bourn to bourn, region to region.
<br />
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
<br />
To use one language in each several clime
<br />
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
<br />
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
<br />
The stages of our story. Pericles
<br />
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
<br />
Attended on by many a lord and knight.
<br />
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
<br />
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
<br />
Advanced in time to great and high estate,
<br />
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
<br />
Old Helicanus goes along behind.
<br />
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
<br />
This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
<br />
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
<br />
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
<br />
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
<br />
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">DUMB SHOW.</i><br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;
CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows
PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes
lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty
passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</i><br />
See how belief may suffer by foul show!
<br />
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
<br />
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
<br />
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears
<br />
o'ershower'd,
<br />
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
<br />
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
<br />
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
<br />
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
<br />
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
<br />
The epitaph is for Marina writ
<br />
By wicked Dionyza.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</i><br />
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
<br />
Who wither'd in her spring of year.
<br />
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
<br />
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
<br />
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
<br />
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
<br />
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
<br />
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
<br />
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
<br />
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
<br />
No visor does become black villany
<br />
So well as soft and tender flattery.
<br />
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
<br />
And bear his courses to be ordered
<br />
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
<br />
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
<br />
In her unholy service. Patience, then,
<br />
And think you now are all in Mytilene.

Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god

of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious

Neither of these are so bad as thou art,

To the choleric fisting of every rogue

As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.

<b class="speaker">BOULT</b>
What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
<br />
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss

of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to

buy him a wooden one?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
<br />
Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
<br />
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
<br />
Any of these ways are yet better than this;
<br />
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
<br />
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
<br />
Would safely deliver me from this place!
<br />
Here, here's gold for thee.
<br />
If that thy master would gain by thee,
<br />
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
<br />
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:
<br />
And I will undertake all these to teach.
<br />
I doubt not but this populous city will
<br />
Yield many scholars.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BOULT</b>
But can you teach all this you speak of?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Prove that I cannot, take me home again,

And prostitute me to the basest groom

That doth frequent your house.

Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can

'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.

Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances

She sings like one immortal, and she dances

Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes

Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,

That even her art sisters the natural roses;
<br />
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
<br />
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,

Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
<br />
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
<br />
And to her father turn our thoughts again,
<br />
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;
<br />
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
<br />
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
<br />
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived

God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence

His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;

<b class="speaker">Tyrian Sailor</b>
Sir,
<br />
This is the man that can, in aught you would,
<br />
Resolve you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
<br />
And die as I would do.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
You wish me well.
<br />
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
<br />
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
<br />
I made to it, to know of whence you are.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
First, what is your place?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
I am the governor of this place you lie before.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Sir,
<br />
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
<br />
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
<br />
To any one, nor taken sustenance
<br />
But to prorogue his grief.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
Upon what ground is his distemperature?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
<br />
But the main grief springs from the loss
<br />
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
May we not see him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
You may;
<br />
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
Yet let me obtain my wish.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Behold him.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">PERICLES discovered</i><br />
This was a goodly person,
<br />
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
<br />
Drove him to this.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
<br />
Hail, royal sir!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Lord</b>
Sir,
<br />
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
<br />
Would win some words of him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
'Tis well bethought.
<br />
She questionless with her sweet harmony
<br />
And other chosen attractions, would allure,
<br />
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
<br />
Which now are midway stopp'd:
<br />
She is all happy as the fairest of all,
<br />
And, with her fellow maids is now upon
<br />
The leafy shelter that abuts against
<br />
The island's side.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of
LYSIMACHUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
<br />
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
<br />
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
<br />
That for our gold we may provision have,
<br />
Wherein we are not destitute for want,
<br />
But weary for the staleness.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
O, sir, a courtesy
<br />
Which if we should deny, the most just gods
<br />
For every graff would send a caterpillar,
<br />
And so afflict our province. Yet once more
<br />
Let me entreat to know at large the cause
<br />
Of your king's sorrow.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
<br />
But, see, I am prevented.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a
young Lady</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
O, here is
<br />
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
<br />
Is't not a goodly presence?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
She's a gallant lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
She's such a one, that, were I well assured
<br />
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
<br />
I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.
<br />
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
<br />
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:
<br />
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
<br />
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
<br />
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
<br />
As thy desires can wish.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Sir, I will use
<br />
My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided
<br />
That none but I and my companion maid
<br />
Be suffer'd to come near him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
Come, let us leave her;
<br />
And the gods make her prosperous!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">MARINA sings</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
Mark'd he your music?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
No, nor look'd on us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
See, she will speak to him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Hum, ha!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
I am a maid,
<br />
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
<br />
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
<br />
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
<br />
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
<br />
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
<br />
My derivation was from ancestors
<br />
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
<br />
But time hath rooted out my parentage,
<br />
And to the world and awkward casualties
<br />
Bound me in servitude.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Aside</i><br />
I will desist;
<br />
But there is something glows upon my cheek,
<br />
And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
<br />
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
<br />
You would not do me violence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
<br />
You are like something that--What country-woman?
<br />
Here of these shores?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
No, nor of any shores:
<br />
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
<br />
No other than I appear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
<br />
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
<br />
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
<br />
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
<br />
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
<br />
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
<br />
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
<br />
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
<br />
You may discern the place.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Where were you bred?
<br />
And how achieved you these endowments, which
<br />
You make more rich to owe?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
If I should tell my history, it would seem
<br />
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Prithee, speak:
<br />
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
<br />
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
<br />
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
<br />
believe thee,
<br />
And make my senses credit thy relation
<br />
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
<br />
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
<br />
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
<br />
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
<br />
From good descending?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
So indeed I did.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
<br />
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
<br />
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
<br />
If both were open'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Some such thing
<br />
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
<br />
Did warrant me was likely.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Tell thy story;
<br />
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
<br />
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
<br />
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
<br />
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
<br />
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
<br />
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
<br />
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
My name is Marina.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
O, I am mock'd,
<br />
And thou by some incensed god sent hither
<br />
To make the world to laugh at me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Patience, good sir,
<br />
Or here I'll cease.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Nay, I'll be patient.
<br />
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
<br />
To call thyself Marina.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
The name
<br />
Was given me by one that had some power,
<br />
My father, and a king.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
How! a king's daughter?
<br />
And call'd Marina?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
You said you would believe me;
<br />
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
<br />
I will end here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
But are you flesh and blood?
<br />
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
<br />
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
<br />
And wherefore call'd Marina?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Call'd Marina
<br />
For I was born at sea.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
At sea! what mother?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
My mother was the daughter of a king;
<br />
Who died the minute I was born,
<br />
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
<br />
Deliver'd weeping.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
O, stop there a little!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Aside</i><br />
This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
<br />
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
<br />
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
<br />
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
<br />
And never interrupt you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I will believe you by the syllable
<br />
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
<br />
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
<br />
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
<br />
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
<br />
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
<br />
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
<br />
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
<br />
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
<br />
It may be,
<br />
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
<br />
I am the daughter to King Pericles,
<br />
If good King Pericles be.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Ho, Helicanus!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Calls my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
<br />
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
<br />
What this maid is, or what is like to be,
<br />
That thus hath made me weep?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
I know not; but
<br />
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
<br />
Speaks nobly of her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
She would never tell
<br />
Her parentage; being demanded that,
<br />
She would sit still and weep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;
<br />
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;
<br />
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
<br />
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
<br />
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
<br />
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
<br />
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
<br />
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
<br />
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
<br />
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
<br />
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
<br />
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
<br />
Though doubts did ever sleep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
First, sir, I pray,
<br />
What is your title?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
<br />
My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
<br />
Thou hast been godlike perfect,
<br />
The heir of kingdoms and another like
<br />
To Pericles thy father.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
Is it no more to be your daughter than
<br />
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
<br />
Thaisa was my mother, who did end
<br />
The minute I began.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
<br />
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
<br />
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
<br />
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;
<br />
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
<br />
She is thy very princess. Who is this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
<br />
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
<br />
Did come to see you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
I embrace you.
<br />
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
<br />
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?
<br />
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
<br />
O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
<br />
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
My lord, I hear none.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
None!
<br />
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.
<br />

It is not good to cross him; give him way.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?

<p>
<b class="speaker">LYSIMACHUS</b>
My lord, I hear.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Music</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Most heavenly music!
<br />
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber

Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
<br />
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
<br />
Who, frighted from my country, did wed
<br />
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
<br />
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
<br />
A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,
<br />
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
<br />
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
<br />
He sought to murder: but her better stars
<br />
Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
<br />
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
<br />
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
<br />
Made known herself my daughter.

This is your wife.

Reverend appearer, no;

Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.

Early in blustering morn this lady was

Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,

Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
<br />
Here in Diana's temple.
<br />

May we see them?

O, let me look!

If he be none of mine, my sanctity

Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,

But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,

Immortal Dian!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Now I know you better.
<br />
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
<br />
The king my father gave you such a ring.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Shows a ring</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
<br />
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
<br />
That on the touching of her lips I may
<br />
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
<br />
A second time within these arms.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARINA</b>
My heart
<br />
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Kneels to THAISA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
<br />
Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina
<br />
For she was yielded there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Blest, and mine own!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HELICANUS</b>
Hail, madam, and my queen!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
I know you not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
<br />
I left behind an ancient substitute:
<br />
Can you remember what I call'd the man?
<br />
I have named him oft.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
'Twas Helicanus then.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Still confirmation:
<br />
Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
<br />
Now do I long to hear how you were found;
<br />
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
<br />
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
<br />
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
<br />
From first to last resolve you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Reverend sir,
<br />
The gods can have no mortal officer
<br />
More like a god than you. Will you deliver
<br />
How this dead queen re-lives?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CERIMON</b>
I will, my lord.
<br />
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
<br />
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
<br />
How she came placed here in the temple;
<br />
No needful thing omitted.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
<br />
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
<br />
This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
<br />
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,
<br />
This ornament
<br />
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
<br />
And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,
<br />
To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THAISA</b>
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
<br />
My father's dead.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PERICLES</b>
Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
<br />
We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
<br />
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:
<br />
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
<br />
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
<br />
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter GOWER</p>

<b class="speaker">GOWER</b>
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
<br />
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
<br />
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
<br />
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
<br />
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
<br />
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
<br />
In Helicanus may you well descry
<br />
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
<br />
In reverend Cerimon there well appears
<br />
The worth that learned charity aye wears:
<br />
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
<br />
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
<br />
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
<br />
That him and his they in his palace burn;
<br />
The gods for murder seemed so content
<br />
To punish them; although not done, but meant.
<br />
So, on your patience evermore attending,
<br />
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
