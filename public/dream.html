                     Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,

                     War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Making it momentany as a sound,

                     Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Brief as the lightning in the collied night,

                     That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So quick bright things come to confusion.

                     It stands as an edict in destiny:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Then let us teach our trial patience,

                     Because it is a customary cross,

                     As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

                     A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.

                     Of great revenue, and she hath no child:

                     From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And she respects me as her only son.

                     There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;

                     And to that place the sharp Athenian law

                     Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,

                     Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;

                     My good Lysander!

                     I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     By his best arrow with the golden head,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
                  
                <br />

                     Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And therefore is Love said to be a child,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So the boy Love is perjured every where:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:

                     Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Pursue her; and for this intelligence

                     To have his sight thither and back again.

                     And the imperial votaress passed on,

                     It fell upon a little western flower,

                     And maidens call it love-in-idleness.

                     We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,

                     And tarry for the comfort of the day.

                     O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Love takes the meaning in love's conference.

                     I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So that but one heart we can make of it;

                     So then two bosoms and a single troth.

                     For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

                     If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.

                       O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!

                     You would not do me thus much injury.

                     To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
                  
                <br />

                <br />

                     A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

                     Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;

                     Due but to one and crowned with one crest.

                     And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To join with men in scorning your poor friend?

                     Did not you tell me I should know the man
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     By the Athenian garment be had on?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;

                     And so far am I glad it so did sort

                     Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
