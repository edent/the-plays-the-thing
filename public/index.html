        For this relief much thanks: ’tis bitter cold,<br/>

        Well, good night.<br/>
        If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br/>

      <p>
        <b class="speaker">FRANCISCO</b>
        I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who’s there?<br/>

        <b class="speaker">FRANCISCO</b>
        Bernardo has my place.<br/>

        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        Say,<br/>
        What, is Horatio there?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        A piece of him.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        What, has this thing appear’d again to‐night?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        I have seen nothing.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,<br/>
        And will not let belief take hold of him<br/>
        Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br/>
        Therefore I have entreated him along<br/>
        With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br/>
        That if again this apparition come,<br/>
        He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        Sit down awhile;<br/>
        And let us once again assail your ears,<br/>
        That are so fortified against our story<br/>
        What we have two nights seen.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Well, sit we down,<br/>
        And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        Last night of all,<br/>
        When yond same star that’s westward from the pole<br/>
        Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br/>
        Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br/>
        The bell then beating one,—<br/>
      </p>
      <p class="stagedir">Enter Ghost</p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        In the same figure, like the king that’s dead.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        It would be spoke to.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Question it, Horatio.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,<br/>
        Together with that fair and warlike form<br/>
        In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br/>
        Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        It is offended.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        See, it stalks away!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!<br/>
      </p>
      <p class="stagedir">Exit Ghost</p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        ’Tis gone, and will not answer.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br/>
        Is not this something more than fantasy?<br/>
        What think you on’t?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Before my God, I might not this believe<br/>
        Without the sensible and true avouch<br/>
        Of mine own eyes.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Is it not like the king?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        As thou art to thyself:<br/>
        Such was the very armour he had on<br/>
        When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br/>
        So frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle,<br/>
        He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br/>
        ’Tis strange.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br/>
        With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        In what particular thought to work I know not;<br/>
        But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br/>
        This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br/>
        Why this same strict and most observant watch<br/>
        So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br/>
        And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br/>
        And foreign mart for implements of war;<br/>
        Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br/>
        Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br/>
        What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br/>
        Doth make the night joint‐labourer with the day:<br/>
        Who is’t that can inform me?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        That can I;<br/>
        At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br/>
        Whose image even but now appear’d to us,<br/>
        Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br/>
        Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,<br/>
        Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet—<br/>
        For so this side of our known world esteem’d him—<br/>
        Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,<br/>
        Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br/>
        Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br/>
        Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br/>
        Against the which, a moiety competent<br/>
        Was gaged by our king; which had return’d<br/>
        To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br/>
        Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br/>
        And carriage of the article design’d,<br/>
        His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br/>
        Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br/>
        Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br/>
        Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,<br/>
        For food and diet, to some enterprise<br/>
        That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other—<br/>
        As it doth well appear unto our state—<br/>
        But to recover of us, by strong hand<br/>
        And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br/>
        So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br/>
        Is the main motive of our preparations,<br/>
        The source of this our watch and the chief head<br/>
        Of this post‐haste and romage in the land.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        I think it be no other but e’en so:<br/>
        Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br/>
        Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br/>
        That was and is the question of these wars.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.<br/>
        In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br/>
        A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br/>
        The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br/>
        Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br/>
        As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br/>
        Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br/>
        Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands<br/>
        Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br/>
        And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br/>
        As harbingers preceding still the fates<br/>
        And prologue to the omen coming on,<br/>
        Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br/>
        Unto our climatures and countrymen.—<br/>
        But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<br/>
        <i class="stagedir">Re‐enter Ghost</i><br/>
        I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br/>
        If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br/>
        Speak to me:<br/>
        If there be any good thing to be done,<br/>
        That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br/>
        Speak to me:<br/>
        <i class="stagedir">Cock crows</i><br/>
        If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,<br/>
        Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br/>
        Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br/>
        Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br/>
        For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br/>
        Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Shall I strike at it with my partisan?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Do, if it will not stand.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        ’Tis here!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        ’Tis here!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        ’Tis gone!<br/>
        <i class="stagedir">Exit Ghost</i><br/>
        We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br/>
        To offer it the show of violence;<br/>
        For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br/>
        And our vain blows malicious mockery.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
        It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        And then it started like a guilty thing<br/>
        Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br/>
        The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br/>
        Doth with his lofty and shrill‐sounding throat<br/>
        Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br/>
        Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br/>
        The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br/>
        To his confine: and of the truth herein<br/>
        This present object made probation.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br/>
        Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes<br/>
        Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,<br/>
        The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br/>
        And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br/>
        The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br/>
        No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br/>
        So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br/>
        But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br/>
        Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br/>
        Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br/>
        Let us impart what we have seen to‐night<br/>
        Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br/>
        This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br/>
        Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br/>
        As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
        Let’s do’t, I pray; and I this morning know<br/>
        Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br/>

      <h3>SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle.</h3>
      <p class="stagedir">Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
and Attendants</p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</b>
        Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death<br/>
        The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br/>
        To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br/>
        To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br/>
        Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br/>
        That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br/>
        Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br/>
        Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br/>
        The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br/>
        Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,—<br/>
        With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br/>
        With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br/>
        In equal scale weighing delight and dole,—<br/>
        Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr’d<br/>
        Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br/>
        With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br/>
        Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br/>
        Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br/>
        Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death<br/>
        Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br/>
        Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br/>
        He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,<br/>
        Importing the surrender of those lands<br/>
        Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br/>
        To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br/>
        Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br/>
        Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br/>
        To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,—<br/>
        Who, impotent and bed‐rid, scarcely hears<br/>
        Of this his nephew’s purpose,—to suppress<br/>
        His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br/>
        The lists and full proportions, are all made<br/>
        Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br/>
        You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br/>
        For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br/>
        Giving to you no further personal power<br/>
        To business with the king, more than the scope<br/>
        Of these delated articles allow.<br/>

        And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?<br/>
        You told us of some suit; what is’t, Laertes?<br/>
        You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br/>
        And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br/>
        That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br/>
        The head is not more native to the heart,<br/>
        The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br/>

        Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br/>
        And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br/>
        Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br/>
        Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br/>
        Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die,<br/>
        Passing through nature to eternity.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        Ay, madam, it is common.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
        If it be,<br/>
        Why seems it so particular with thee?<br/>

      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not ‘seems.’<br/>
        ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br/>
        Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br/>
        Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br/>
        No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br/>
        Nor the dejected ’havior of the visage,<br/>
        Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br/>
        That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br/>
        For they are actions that a man might play:<br/>
        But I have that within which passeth show;<br/>
        These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br/>

      <p>
        <b class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</b>
        ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br/>
        To give these mourning duties to your father:<br/>
        But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br/>
        That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br/>
        In filial obligation for some term<br/>
        To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br/>
        In obstinate condolement is a course<br/>
        Of impious stubbornness; ’tis unmanly grief;<br/>
        It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br/>
        A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br/>
        An understanding simple and unschool’d:<br/>
        For what we know must be and is as common<br/>
        As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br/>
        Why should we in our peevish opposition<br/>
        Take it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven,<br/>
        A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br/>
        To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br/>
        Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br/>
        From the first corse till he that died to‐day,<br/>
        ‘This must be so.’ We pray you, throw to earth<br/>
        This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br/>
        As of a father: for let the world take note,<br/>
        You are the most immediate to our throne;<br/>
        And with no less nobility of love<br/>
        Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br/>
        Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br/>
        In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br/>
        It is most retrograde to our desire:<br/>
        And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br/>
        Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br/>
        Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>

        Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply:<br/>
        Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br/>
        This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br/>
        Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br/>
        No jocund health that Denmark drinks to‐day,<br/>
        But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br/>
        And the king’s rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br/>

        O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br/>

        His canon ’gainst self‐slaughter! O God! God!<br/>

        Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br/>
        Fie on’t! ah fie! ’tis an unweeded garden,<br/>
        That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br/>
        Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br/>
        But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br/>
        So excellent a king; that was, to this,<br/>
        Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br/>
        That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br/>
        Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br/>
        Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br/>
        As if increase of appetite had grown<br/>
        By what it fed on: and yet, within a month—<br/>
        Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!—<br/>
        A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br/>
        With which she follow’d my poor father’s body,<br/>
        Like Niobe, all tears:—why she, even she—<br/>
        O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br/>
        Would have mourn’d longer—married with my uncle,<br/>
        My father’s brother, but no more like my father<br/>
        Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br/>
        Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br/>
        Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br/>
        She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br/>
        With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br/>
        It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br/>
        But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.<br/>

        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br/>
        Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,<br/>
        In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br/>
        Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,<br/>
        Armed at point exactly, cap‐a‐pe,<br/>
        Appears before them, and with solemn march<br/>
        Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d<br/>
        By their oppress’d and fear‐surprised eyes,<br/>
        Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distilled<br/>
        Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br/>
        Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br/>
        In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br/>
        And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br/>
        Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,<br/>
        Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br/>
        The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br/>
        These hands are not more like.<br/>

        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        My lord, I did;<br/>
        But answer made it none: yet once methought<br/>
        It lifted up its head and did address<br/>
        Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br/>
        But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br/>
        And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br/>
        And vanish’d from our sight.<br/>

        But let me hear from you.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">OPHELIA</b>
        Do you doubt that?<br/>

      <p>
        <b class="speaker">LAERTES</b>
        For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br/>
        Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br/>
        A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br/>
        Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br/>
        The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">OPHELIA</b>
        No more but so?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">LAERTES</b>
        Think it no more;<br/>
        For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br/>
        In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br/>
        The inward service of the mind and soul<br/>
        Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br/>
        And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br/>
        The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br/>
        His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;<br/>
        For he himself is subject to his birth:<br/>
        He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br/>
        Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br/>
        The safety and health of this whole state;<br/>
        And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br/>
        Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br/>
        Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br/>
        It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br/>
        As he in his particular act and place<br/>
        May give his saying deed; which is no further<br/>
        Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br/>
        Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br/>
        If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br/>
        Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br/>
        To his unmaster’d importunity.<br/>
        Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br/>
        And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br/>
        Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br/>
        The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br/>
        If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br/>
        Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes:<br/>
        The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br/>
        Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br/>
        And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br/>
        Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br/>
        Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br/>
        Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.<br/>

        Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br/>
        Whiles, like a puff’d and reckless libertine,<br/>
        Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br/>
        And recks not his own rede.<br/>

        Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br/>
        The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br/>
        And you are stay’d for. There; my blessing with thee!<br/>
        And these few precepts in thy memory<br/>
        See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br/>
        Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br/>
        Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br/>
        Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br/>
        Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br/>
        But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br/>
        Of each new‐hatch’d, unfledged comrade. Beware<br/>
        Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br/>
        Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee.<br/>
        Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br/>
        Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br/>
        Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br/>
        But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br/>
        For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br/>
        And they in France of the best rank and station<br/>
        Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br/>
        Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br/>
        For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br/>
        And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br/>
        This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br/>
        And it must follow, as the night the day,<br/>
        Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br/>
        Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!<br/>

        So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.<br/>

        Marry, well bethought:<br/>
        ’Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br/>
        Given private time to you; and you yourself<br/>
        Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:<br/>
        If it be so, as so ’tis put on me,<br/>
        And that in way of caution, I must tell you,<br/>
        You do not understand yourself so clearly<br/>
        As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br/>
        What is between you? give me up the truth.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">OPHELIA</b>
        He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br/>
        Of his affection to me.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</b>
        Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,<br/>
        Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br/>
        Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">OPHELIA</b>
        I do not know, my lord, what I should think.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</b>
        Marry, I’ll teach you: think yourself a baby;<br/>
        That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,<br/>
        Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br/>
        Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br/>
        Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">OPHELIA</b>
        My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br/>
        In honourable fashion.<br/>

      </p>

        <b class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</b>
        Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br/>
        When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br/>
        Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br/>
        Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br/>
        Even in their promise, as it is a‐making,<br/>
        You must not take for fire. From this time<br/>
        Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;<br/>
        Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br/>
        Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br/>
        Believe so much in him, that he is young<br/>
        And with a larger tether may he walk<br/>
        Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,<br/>
        Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br/>
        Not of that dye which their investments show,<br/>
        But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br/>
        Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br/>
        The better to beguile. This is for all:<br/>
        I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br/>
        Have you so slander any moment leisure,<br/>
        As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br/>
        Look to’t, I charge you: come your ways.<br/>

        The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        It is a nipping and an eager air.<br/>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season<br/>
        Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.<br/>
        <i class="stagedir">A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</i><br/>
        What does this mean, my lord?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        The king doth wake to‐night and takes his rouse,<br/>
        Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up‐spring reels;<br/>
        And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,<br/>
        The kettle‐drum and trumpet thus bray out<br/>
        The triumph of his pledge.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
        Is it a custom?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        Ay, marry, is’t:<br/>
        But to my mind, though I am native here<br/>
        And to the manner born, it is a custom<br/>
        More honour’d in the breach than the observance.<br/>
        This heavy‐headed revel east and west<br/>
        Makes us traduced and tax’d of other nations:<br/>
        They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br/>
        Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br/>
        From our achievements, though perform’d at height,<br/>
        The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br/>
        So, oft it chances in particular men,<br/>
        That for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br/>
        As, in their birth—wherein they are not guilty,<br/>
        Since nature cannot choose his origin—<br/>
        By the o’ergrowth of some complexion,<br/>
        Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br/>
        Or by some habit that too much o’er‐leavens<br/>
        The form of plausive manners, that these men,<br/>
        Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<br/>
        Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star,—<br/>
        Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace,<br/>
        As infinite as man may undergo—<br/>
        Shall in the general censure take corruption<br/>
        From that particular fault: the dram of eale<br/>
        Doth all the noble substance of a doubt<br/>
        To his own scandal.<br/>

        Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,<br/>

        And each particular hair to stand on end,<br/>
        Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:<br/>
        But this eternal blazon must not be<br/>
        To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br/>
        If thou didst ever thy dear father love—<br/>

        O God!<br/>

        Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        Murder!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">Ghost</b>
        Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br/>
        But this most foul, strange and unnatural.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift<br/>
        As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br/>
        May sweep to my revenge.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">Ghost</b>
        I find thee apt;<br/>
        And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br/>
        That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br/>
        Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:<br/>
        ’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br/>
        A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br/>
        Is by a forged process of my death<br/>
        Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,<br/>
        The serpent that did sting thy father’s life<br/>
        Now wears his crown.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">HAMLET</b>
        O my prophetic soul! My uncle!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="speaker">Ghost</b>
        Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br/>
        With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—<br/>
        O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br/>
        So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust<br/>
        The will of my most seeming‐virtuous queen:<br/>
        O Hamlet, what a falling‐off was there!<br/>
        From me, whose love was of that dignity<br/>
        That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br/>
        I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br/>
        Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br/>
        To those of mine!<br/>
        But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br/>
        Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br/>
        So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,<br/>
        Will sate itself in a celestial bed,<br/>
        And prey on garbage.<br/>
        But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br/>
        Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br/>
        My custom always of the afternoon,<br/>
        Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br/>
        With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br/>
        And in the porches of my ears did pour<br/>
        The leperous distilment; whose effect<br/>
        Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br/>
        That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br/>
        The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br/>
        And with a sudden vigour doth posset<br/>
        And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br/>
        The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;<br/>
        And a most instant tetter bark’d about,<br/>
        Most lazar‐like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br/>
        All my smooth body.<br/>
        Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand<br/>
        Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d:<br/>
        Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br/>
        Unhousel’d, disappointed, unanel’d,<br/>
        No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br/>
        With all my imperfections on my head:<br/>
        O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br/>
        If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br/>
        Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br/>
        A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br/>
        But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br/>
        Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br/>
        Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven<br/>
        And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br/>
        To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br/>
        The glow‐worm shows the matin to be near,<br/>
        And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire:<br/>
        Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.<br/>

        O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?<br/>

        And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br/>
        But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br/>
        Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br/>
        In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br/>
        Yea, from the table of my memory<br/>
        I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br/>
        All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br/>
        That youth and observation copied there;<br/>
        And thy commandment all alone shall live<br/>
        Within the book and volume of my brain,<br/>
        Unmix’d with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br/>
        O most pernicious woman!<br/>
        O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br/>
        My tables,—meet it is I set it down,<br/>
        That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;<br/>
        At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark:<br/>

        That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br/>
        With arms encumber’d thus, or this headshake,<br/>
