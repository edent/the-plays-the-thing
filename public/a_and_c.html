                     Nay, but this dotage of our general's                <br />
                     O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,                <br />
                     That o'er the files and musters of the war                <br />
                     Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,                <br />
                     The office and devotion of their view                <br />
                     Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,                <br />
                     Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst                <br />
                     The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,                <br />
                     And is become the bellows and the fan                <br />
                     To cool a gipsy's lust.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">CLEOPATRA</b>
                     Nay, hear them, Antony:                <br />
                     Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows                <br />
                     If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent                <br />
                     His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;                <br />
                     Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CLEOPATRA</b>
                     Perchance! nay, and most like:                <br />
                     You must not stay here longer, your dismission                <br />
                     Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.                <br />
                     Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?                <br />
                     Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,                <br />
                     Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine                <br />
                     Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame                <br />
                     When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!                <br />

                     Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch                <br />
                     Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.                <br />

                     We stand up peerless.                <br />

                     Excellent falsehood!                <br />
                     Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?                <br />
                     I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony                <br />
                     Will be himself.                <br />

                     To-night we'll wander through the streets and note                <br />
                     The qualities of people. Come, my queen;                <br />
                     Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.                <br />

                     nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of                <br />
                     this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty                <br />
                     times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is                <br />
                     mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon                <br />
                     her, she hath such a celerity in dying.                <br />

                     Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but                <br />
                     the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her                <br />
                     winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater                <br />
                     storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this                <br />
                     cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a                <br />

            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When                <br />
                     it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man                <br />
                     from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;                <br />
                     comforting therein, that when old robes are worn                <br />
                     out, there are members to make new. If there were                <br />
                     no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,                <br />
                     and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned                <br />
                     with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new                <br />
                     petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion                <br />
                     that should water this sorrow.                <br />

                     Have notice what we purpose. I shall break                <br />

                     And get her leave to part. For not alone                <br />
                     The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,                <br />

                     Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands                <br />
                     The empire of the sea: our slippery people,                <br />
                     Whose love is never link'd to the deserver                <br />
                     Till his deserts are past, begin to throw                <br />
                     Pompey the Great and all his dignities                <br />
                     Upon his son; who, high in name and power,                <br />
                     Higher than both in blood and life, stands up                <br />
                     For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,                <br />
                     The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,                <br />
                     Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,                <br />
                     And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,                <br />
                     To such whose place is under us, requires                <br />

                     Though age from folly could not give me freedom,                <br />
                     It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?                <br />

                     Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill                <br />

                     You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,                <br />
                     It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate                <br />
                     Our great competitor: from Alexandria                <br />
                     This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes                <br />
                     The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like                <br />
                     Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy                <br />
                     More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or                <br />
                     Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there                <br />
                     A man who is the abstract of all faults                <br />
                     That all men follow.                <br />

                     His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,                <br />
                     More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,                <br />
                     Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,                <br />
                     Than what he chooses.                <br />

                     To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit                <br />
                     And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;                <br />
                     To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet                <br />
                     With knaves that smell of sweat: say this                <br />

                     As his composure must be rare indeed                <br />
                     Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony                <br />
                     No way excuse his soils, when we do bear                <br />
                     So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd                <br />
                     His vacancy with his voluptuousness,                <br />
                     Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,                <br />
                     Call on him for't: but to confound such time,                <br />
                     That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud                <br />
                     As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid                <br />
                     As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,                <br />
                     Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,                <br />

                     Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once                <br />
                     Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st                <br />
                     Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel                <br />

                     Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink                <br />

                     Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek                <br />

                     Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?                <br />
                     Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?                <br />
                     O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!                <br />
                     Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?                <br />
                     The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm                <br />
                     And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,                <br />
                     Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'                <br />
                     For so he calls me: now I feed myself                <br />
                     With most delicious poison. Think on me,                <br />
                     That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,                <br />
                     And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,                <br />
                     When thou wast here above the ground, I was                <br />
                     A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey                <br />
                     Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;                <br />
                     There would he anchor his aspect and die                <br />

                     He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--                <br />
                     This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.                <br />

                     This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,                <br />

                     Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers                <br />

                     No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where                <br />
                     He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,                <br />

                     And have my learning from some true reports,                <br />
                     That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather                <br />
                     Discredit my authority with yours;                <br />
                     And make the wars alike against my stomach,                <br />
                     Having alike your cause? Of this my letters                <br />

                     You praise yourself                <br />
                     By laying defects of judgment to me; but                <br />
                     You patch'd up your excuses.                <br />

                     Not so, not so;                <br />
                     I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,                <br />
                     Very necessity of this thought, that I,                <br />
                     Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,                <br />
                     Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars                <br />
                     Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,                <br />
                     I would you had her spirit in such another:                <br />
                     The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle                <br />
                     You may pace easy, but not such a wife.                <br />

                     Would we had all such wives, that the men might go                <br />
                     to wars with the women!                <br />

                     So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar                <br />
                     Made out of her impatience, which not wanted                <br />
                     Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant                <br />
                     Did you too much disquiet: for that you must                <br />

                     Did gibe my missive out of audience.                <br />

                     Sir,                <br />
                     He fell upon me ere admitted: then                <br />
                     Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want                <br />
                     Of what I was i' the morning: but next day                <br />
                     I told him of myself; which was as much                <br />
                     As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow                <br />
                     Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,                <br />
                     Out of our question wipe him.                <br />

                     You have broken                <br />
                     The article of your oath; which you shall never                <br />
                     Have tongue to charge me with.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     No,                <br />
                     Lepidus, let him speak:                <br />
                     The honour is sacred which he talks on now,                <br />
                     Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;                <br />
                     The article of my oath.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b>
                     To lend me arms and aid when I required them;                <br />
                     The which you both denied.                <br />

                     Neglected, rather;                <br />
                     And then when poison'd hours had bound me up                <br />
                     From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,                <br />
                     I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty                <br />
                     Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power                <br />
                     Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,                <br />
                     To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;                <br />
                     For which myself, the ignorant motive, do                <br />
                     So far ask pardon as befits mine honour                <br />
                     To stoop in such a case.                <br />

                     The manner of his speech; for't cannot be                <br />
                     We shall remain in friendship, our conditions                <br />
                     So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew                <br />
                     What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge                <br />

                     Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,                <br />
                     Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony                <br />
                     Is now a widower.                <br />

                     If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof                <br />
                     Were well deserved of rashness.                <br />

                     To hold you in perpetual amity,                <br />

                     No worse a husband than the best of men;                <br />
                     Whose virtue and whose general graces speak                <br />
                     That which none else can utter. By this marriage,                <br />
                     All little jealousies, which now seem great,                <br />

                     Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,                <br />
                     Where now half tales be truths: her love to both                <br />
                     Would, each to other and all loves to both,                <br />
                     Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;                <br />

                     I will tell you.                <br />
                     The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,                <br />
                     Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;                <br />
                     Purple the sails, and so perfumed that                <br />
                     The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,                <br />
                     Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made                <br />
                     The water which they beat to follow faster,                <br />
                     As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,                <br />
                     It beggar'd all description: she did lie                <br />
                     In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--                <br />
                     O'er-picturing that Venus where we see                <br />
                     The fancy outwork nature: on each side her                <br />
                     Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,                <br />
                     With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem                <br />
                     To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,                <br />
                     And what they undid did.                <br />

                     Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,                <br />
                     So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,                <br />
                     And made their bends adornings: at the helm                <br />
                     A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle                <br />
                     Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,                <br />

                     A strange invisible perfume hits the sense                <br />
                     Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast                <br />
                     Her people out upon her; and Antony,                <br />
                     Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,                <br />
                     Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,                <br />
                     Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,                <br />
                     And made a gap in nature.                <br />

                     Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,                <br />
                     Invited her to supper: she replied,                <br />
                     It should be better he became her guest;                <br />
                     Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,                <br />
                     Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,                <br />
                     Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>

                     Hop forty paces through the public street;                <br />
                     And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,                <br />
                     That she did make defect perfection,                <br />

                     Become themselves in her: that the holy priests                <br />

                     The praise of it by telling, you must know,                <br />
                     When Caesar and your brother were at blows,                <br />
                     Your mother came to Sicily and did find                <br />
                     Her welcome friendly.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     I have heard it, Pompey;                <br />
                     And am well studied for a liberal thanks                <br />
                     Which I do owe you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     Let me have your hand:                <br />
                     I did not think, sir, to have met you here.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,                <br />
                     That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;                <br />
                     For I have gain'd by 't.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b>
                     Since I saw you last,                <br />
                     There is a change upon you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     Well, I know not                <br />
                     What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;                <br />
                     But in my bosom shall she never come,                <br />
                     To make my heart her vassal.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">LEPIDUS</b>
                     Well met here.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:                <br />
                     I crave our composition may be written,                <br />
                     And seal'd between us.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b>
                     That's the next to do.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's                <br />
                     Draw lots who shall begin.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     That will I, Pompey.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     No, Antony, take the lot: but, first                <br />
                     Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery                <br />
                     Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar                <br />
                     Grew fat with feasting there.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     You have heard much.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     I have fair meanings, sir.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     And fair words to them.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POMPEY</b>
                     Then so much have I heard:                <br />
                     And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--                <br />

                     And well am like to do; for, I perceive,                <br />
                     Four feasts are toward.                <br />

                     I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,                <br />
                     When I have envied thy behavior.                <br />

                     I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,                <br />
                     When you have well deserved ten times as much                <br />
                     As I have said you did.                <br />

                     Aboard my galley I invite you all:                <br />

            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>

            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     Yes, something you can deny for your own                <br />
                     safety: you have been a great thief by sea.                <br />

                     might take two thieves kissing.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony                <br />
                     here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     Caesar's sister is called Octavia.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     Pray ye, sir?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     'Tis true.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would                <br />
                     not prophesy so.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     I think the policy of that purpose made more in the                <br />
                     marriage than the love of the parties.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     I think so too. But you shall find, the band that                <br />
                     seems to tie their friendship together will be the                <br />
                     very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a                <br />
                     holy, cold, and still conversation.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     Who would not have his wife so?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.                <br />
                     He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the                <br />
                     sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as                <br />
                     I said before, that which is the strength of their                <br />
                     amity shall prove the immediate author of their                <br />
                     variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:                <br />
                     he married but his occasion here.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENAS</b>
                     And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?                <br />
                     I have a health for you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</b>
                     I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.                <br />

                     Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.                <br />

                     His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,                <br />

                     When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,                <br />

                     troubled with a rheum;                <br />
                     What willingly he did confound he wail'd,                <br />

                     Most absolute lord,                <br />
                     My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DIOMEDES</b>
                     Now, my lord.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MARK ANTONY</b>
                     Where is she?                <br />

                     Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear                <br />
                     Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--                <br />
                     Which never shall be found--you did suspect                <br />
                     She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage                <br />
                     Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;                <br />
                     But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent                <br />
                     Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,                <br />
                     I dread, too late.                <br />

                     Patience is scottish, and impatience does                <br />
                     Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin                <br />

                     Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?                <br />
                     What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!                <br />
                     My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,                <br />
                     Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:                <br />
                     We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,                <br />
                     what's noble,                <br />
                     Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,                <br />
                     And make death proud to take us. Come, away:                <br />
                     This case of that huge spirit now is cold:                <br />
                     Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend                <br />
                     But resolution, and the briefest end.                <br />

                     To make it clear; but do confess I have                <br />

                     We will extenuate rather than enforce:                <br />

                     A benefit in this change; but if you seek                <br />
                     To lay on me a cruelty, by taking                <br />

                     Of my good purposes, and put your children                <br />

            <b class="speaker">CLEOPATRA</b>
                     See, Caesar! O, behold,                <br />
                     How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;                <br />
                     And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.                <br />
                     The ingratitude of this Seleucus does                <br />
                     Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust                <br />
                     Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt                <br />
                     Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,                <br />
                     Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!                <br />
                     O rarely base!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">CLEOPATRA</b>
                     O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,                <br />
                     That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,                <br />
                     Doing the honour of thy lordliness                <br />
                     To one so meek, that mine own servant should                <br />
                     Parcel the sum of my disgraces by                <br />
                     Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,                <br />
                     That I some lady trifles have reserved,                <br />
                     Immoment toys, things of such dignity                <br />
                     As we greet modern friends withal; and say,                <br />
                     Some nobler token I have kept apart                <br />
                     For Livia and Octavia, to induce                <br />
                     Their mediation; must I be unfolded                <br />
                     With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me                <br />
                     Beneath the fall I have.                <br />

                     Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;                <br />

                     What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?                <br />

            <b class="speaker">CHARMIAN</b>
                     It is well done, and fitting for a princess                <br />
                     Descended of so many royal kings.                <br />

                     O Caesar,                <br />
                     This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:                <br />
                     I found her trimming up the diadem                <br />
                     On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood                <br />
                     And on the sudden dropp'd.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OCTAVIUS CAESAR</b>
                     O noble weakness!                <br />
                     If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear                <br />
                     By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,                <br />
                     As she would catch another Antony                <br />
                     In her strong toil of grace.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DOLABELLA</b>
                     Here, on her breast,                <br />
                     There is a vent of blood and something blown:                <br />
                     The like is on her arm.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">First Guard</b>
                     This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves                <br />
                     Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves                <br />
                     Upon the caves of Nile.                <br />

                     Most probable                <br />
                     That so she died; for her physician tells me                <br />
                     She hath pursued conclusions infinite                <br />
                     Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;                <br />
                     And bear her women from the monument:                <br />
                     She shall be buried by her Antony:                <br />
                     No grave upon the earth shall clip in it                <br />
                     A pair so famous. High events as these                <br />
                     Strike those that make them; and their story is                <br />
                     No less in pity than his glory which                <br />
                     Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall                <br />
                     In solemn show attend this funeral;                <br />
                     And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see                <br />
                     High order in this great solemnity.                <br />
