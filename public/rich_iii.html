<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter GLOUCESTER, solus</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Now is the winter of our discontent
<br />
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
<br />
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
<br />
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
<br />
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
<br />
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
<br />
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
<br />
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
<br />
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
<br />
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
<br />
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
<br />
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
<br />
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
<br />
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
<br />
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
<br />
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
<br />
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
<br />
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
<br />
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
<br />
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
<br />
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
<br />
And that so lamely and unfashionable
<br />
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
<br />
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
<br />
Have no delight to pass away the time,
<br />
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
<br />
And descant on mine own deformity:
<br />
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
<br />
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
<br />
I am determined to prove a villain
<br />
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
<br />
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
<br />
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
<br />
To set my brother Clarence and the king
<br />
In deadly hate the one against the other:
<br />
And if King Edward be as true and just
<br />
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
<br />
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
<br />
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
<br />
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
<br />
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
<br />
Clarence comes.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</i><br />
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
<br />
That waits upon your grace?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
His majesty
<br />
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
<br />
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Upon what cause?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Because my name is George.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
<br />
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
<br />
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
<br />
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
<br />
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
<br />
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
<br />
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
<br />
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
<br />
And says a wizard told him that by G
<br />
His issue disinherited should be;
<br />
And, for my name of George begins with G,
<br />
It follows in his thought that I am he.
<br />
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
<br />
Have moved his highness to commit me now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
<br />
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
<br />
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
<br />
That tempers him to this extremity.
<br />
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
<br />
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
<br />
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
<br />
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
<br />
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
<br />
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
<br />
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
<br />
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
<br />
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Humbly complaining to her deity
<br />
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
<br />
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
<br />
If we will keep in favour with the king,
<br />
To be her men and wear her livery:
<br />
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
<br />
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
<br />
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
<br />
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
<br />
That no man shall have private conference,
<br />
Of what degree soever, with his brother.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
<br />
You may partake of any thing we say:
<br />
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
<br />
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
<br />
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
<br />
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
<br />
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
<br />
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
<br />
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
<br />
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
<br />
Were best he do it secretly, alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
What one, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
<br />
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
<br />
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
<br />
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
<br />
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
<br />
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
<br />
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
<br />
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
<br />
Meantime, have patience.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
I must perforce. Farewell.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
<br />
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
<br />
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
<br />
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
<br />
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter HASTINGS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
<br />
Well are you welcome to the open air.
<br />
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
<br />
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
<br />
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
<br />
For they that were your enemies are his,
<br />
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
<br />
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What news abroad?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
<br />
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
<br />
And his physicians fear him mightily.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
<br />
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
<br />
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
<br />
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
<br />
What, is he in his bed?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
He is.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Go you before, and I will follow you.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit HASTINGS</i><br />
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
<br />
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
<br />
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
<br />
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
<br />
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
<br />
Clarence hath not another day to live:
<br />
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
<br />
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
<br />
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
<br />
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
<br />
The readiest way to make the wench amends
<br />
Is to become her husband and her father:
<br />
The which will I; not all so much for love
<br />
As for another secret close intent,
<br />
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
<br />
But yet I run before my horse to market:
<br />
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
<br />
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
<br />

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. Another street. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Set down, set down your honourable load,
<br />
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
<br />
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
<br />
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
<br />
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
<br />
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
<br />
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
<br />
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
<br />
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
<br />
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
<br />
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
<br />
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
<br />
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
<br />
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
<br />
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
<br />
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
<br />
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
<br />
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
<br />
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
<br />
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
<br />
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
<br />
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
<br />
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
<br />
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
<br />
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
<br />
If ever he have wife, let her he made
<br />
A miserable by the death of him
<br />
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
<br />
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
<br />
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
<br />
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
<br />
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter GLOUCESTER</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
<br />
To stop devoted charitable deeds?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
<br />
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
<br />
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
<br />
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
<br />
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
<br />
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
<br />
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
<br />
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
<br />
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
<br />
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
<br />
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
<br />
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
<br />
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
<br />
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
<br />
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
<br />
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
<br />
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
<br />
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
<br />
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
<br />
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
<br />
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
<br />
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
<br />
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
<br />
Either heaven with lightning strike the
<br />
murderer dead,
<br />
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
<br />
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
<br />
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
<br />
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
<br />
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
<br />
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
<br />
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
<br />
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
<br />
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
<br />
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
<br />
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
<br />
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
By such despair, I should accuse myself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
<br />
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
<br />
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Say that I slew them not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Why, then they are not dead:
<br />
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I did not kill your husband.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Why, then he is alive.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
<br />
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
<br />
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
<br />
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
<br />
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
<br />
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
<br />
Didst thou not kill this king?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I grant ye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
<br />
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
<br />
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
<br />
For he was fitter for that place than earth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Some dungeon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Your bed-chamber.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
So will it, madam till I lie with you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
I hope so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
<br />
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
<br />
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
<br />
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
<br />
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
<br />
As blameful as the executioner?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
<br />
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
<br />
To undertake the death of all the world,
<br />
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
<br />
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
<br />
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
<br />
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
<br />
So I by that; it is my day, my life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
<br />
To be revenged on him that loveth you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
<br />
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
<br />
Did it to help thee to a better husband.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Name him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Plantagenet.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Why, that was he.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Where is he?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Here.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">She spitteth at him</i><br />
Why dost thou spit at me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
<br />
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I would they were, that I might die at once;
<br />
For now they kill me with a living death.
<br />
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
<br />
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
<br />
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
<br />
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
<br />
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
<br />
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
<br />
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
<br />
Told the sad story of my father's death,
<br />
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
<br />
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
<br />
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
<br />
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
<br />
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
<br />
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
<br />
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
<br />
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
<br />
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
<br />
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">She looks scornfully at him</i><br />
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
<br />
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
<br />
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
<br />
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
<br />
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
<br />
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
<br />
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
<br />
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</i><br />
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
<br />
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
<br />
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
<br />
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Here she lets fall the sword</i><br />
Take up the sword again, or take up me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
<br />
I will not be the executioner.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
I have already.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Tush, that was in thy rage:
<br />
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
<br />
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
<br />
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
<br />
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
I would I knew thy heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
'Tis figured in my tongue.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
I fear me both are false.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Then never man was true.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Well, well, put up your sword.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Say, then, my peace is made.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
That shall you know hereafter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
But shall I live in hope?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
All men, I hope, live so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
To take is not to give.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
<br />
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
<br />
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
<br />
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
<br />
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
<br />
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
What is it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
<br />
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
<br />
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
<br />
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
<br />
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
<br />
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
<br />
I will with all expedient duty see you:
<br />
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
<br />
Grant me this boon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
<br />
To see you are become so penitent.
<br />
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Bid me farewell.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
'Tis more than you deserve;
<br />
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
<br />
Imagine I have said farewell already.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Sirs, take up the corse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GENTLEMEN</b>
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</i><br />
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
<br />
Was ever woman in this humour won?
<br />
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
<br />
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
<br />
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
<br />
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
<br />
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
<br />
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
<br />
against me,
<br />
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
<br />
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
<br />
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
<br />
Ha!
<br />
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
<br />
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
<br />
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
<br />
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
<br />
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
<br />
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
<br />
The spacious world cannot again afford
<br />
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
<br />
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
<br />
And made her widow to a woful bed?
<br />
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
<br />
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
<br />
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
<br />
I do mistake my person all this while:
<br />
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
<br />
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
<br />
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
<br />
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
<br />
To study fashions to adorn my body:
<br />
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
<br />
Will maintain it with some little cost.
<br />
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
<br />
And then return lamenting to my love.
<br />
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
<br />
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

<h3>SCENE III.  The palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
<br />
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GREY</b>
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
<br />
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
<br />
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
If he were dead, what would betide of me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GREY</b>
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
<br />
To be your comforter when he is gone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Oh, he is young and his minority
<br />
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
<br />
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
It is determined, not concluded yet:
<br />
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GREY</b>
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Good time of day unto your royal grace!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DERBY</b>
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
<br />
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
<br />
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
<br />
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
<br />
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DERBY</b>
I do beseech you, either not believe
<br />
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
<br />
Or, if she be accused in true report,
<br />
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
<br />
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DERBY</b>
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
<br />
Are come from visiting his majesty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
<br />
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
<br />
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
<br />
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Would all were well! but that will never be
<br />
I fear our happiness is at the highest.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
<br />
Who are they that complain unto the king,
<br />
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
<br />
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
<br />
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
<br />
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
<br />
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
<br />
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
<br />
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
<br />
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
<br />
But thus his simple truth must be abused
<br />
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
<br />
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
<br />
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
<br />
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
<br />
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
<br />
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
<br />
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
<br />
The king, of his own royal disposition,
<br />
And not provoked by any suitor else;
<br />
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
<br />
Which in your outward actions shows itself
<br />
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
<br />
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
<br />
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
<br />
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
<br />
Since every Jack became a gentleman
<br />
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
<br />
Gloucester;
<br />
You envy my advancement and my friends':
<br />
God grant we never may have need of you!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
<br />
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
<br />
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
<br />
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
<br />
Are daily given to ennoble those
<br />
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
By Him that raised me to this careful height
<br />
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
<br />
I never did incense his majesty
<br />
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
<br />
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
<br />
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
<br />
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
You may deny that you were not the cause
<br />
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
She may, my lord, for--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
<br />
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
<br />
She may help you to many fair preferments,
<br />
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
<br />
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
<br />
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
What, marry, may she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
<br />
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
<br />
I wis your grandam had a worser match.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
<br />
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
<br />
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
<br />
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
<br />
I had rather be a country servant-maid
<br />
Than a great queen, with this condition,
<br />
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind</i><br />
Small joy have I in being England's queen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
<br />
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
<br />
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
<br />
I will avouch in presence of the king:
<br />
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
<br />
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Out, devil! I remember them too well:
<br />
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
<br />
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
<br />
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
<br />
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
<br />
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
<br />
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
In all which time you and your husband Grey
<br />
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
<br />
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
<br />
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
<br />
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
<br />
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
<br />
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
<br />
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Which God revenge!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
<br />
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
<br />
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
<br />
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
<br />
I am too childish-foolish for this world.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
<br />
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
<br />
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
<br />
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
<br />
So should we you, if you should be our king.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
<br />
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
<br />
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
<br />
As little joy may you suppose in me.
<br />
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
<br />
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
<br />
I can no longer hold me patient.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Advancing</i><br />
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
<br />
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
<br />
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
<br />
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
<br />
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
<br />
O gentle villain, do not turn away!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
<br />
That will I make before I let thee go.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
<br />
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
<br />
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
<br />
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
<br />
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
<br />
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
<br />
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
<br />
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
<br />
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
<br />
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
<br />
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
<br />
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
<br />
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
So just is God, to right the innocent.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
<br />
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DORSET</b>
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
What were you snarling all before I came,
<br />
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
<br />
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
<br />
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
<br />
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
<br />
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
<br />
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
<br />
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
<br />
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
<br />
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
<br />
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
<br />
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
<br />
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
<br />
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
<br />
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
<br />
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
<br />
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
<br />
And see another, as I see thee now,
<br />
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
<br />
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
<br />
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
<br />
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
<br />
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
<br />
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
<br />
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
<br />
That none of you may live your natural age,
<br />
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
<br />
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
<br />
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
<br />
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
<br />
And then hurl down their indignation
<br />
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
<br />
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
<br />
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
<br />
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
<br />
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
<br />
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
<br />
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
<br />
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
<br />
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
<br />
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
<br />
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!

Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!

Ha!

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
I call thee not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
<br />
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
<br />
O, let me make the period to my curse!
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>

Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
<br />
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
<br />
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
<br />
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
<br />
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
<br />
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
<br />
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
<br />
O, that your young nobility could judge
<br />
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
<br />
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;

And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
<br />
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
<br />
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
<br />
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
<br />
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
<br />
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
<br />
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
<br />
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
<br />
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!

<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
<br />
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
<br />
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
<br />
My charity is outrage, life my shame
<br />
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.

O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
<br />
In sign of league and amity with thee:
<br />
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
<br />
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
<br />
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
<br />
</p>

Nor no one here; for curses never pass
<br />
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
<br />
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
<br />
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
<br />
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
<br />
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
<br />
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
<br />
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
<br />
And all their ministers attend on him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
<br />
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
<br />
O, but remember this another day,
<br />
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
<br />
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!

Live each of you the subjects to his hate,

And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,

She hath had too much wrong; and I repent

I was too hot to do somebody good,

That is too cold in thinking of it now.

He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains

The secret mischiefs that I set abroach

I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
<br />
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
<br />
I do beweep to many simple gulls

Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
<br />
And say it is the queen and her allies

That stir the king against the duke my brother.

Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
<br />
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:

But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
<br />
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
<br />
And thus I clothe my naked villany

With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;

And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.

<h3>SCENE IV.  London. The Tower. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
<br />
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
<br />
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
<br />
I would not spend another such a night,
<br />
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
<br />
So full of dismal terror was the time!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
<br />
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
<br />
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
<br />
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
<br />
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
<br />
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
<br />
During the wars of York and Lancaster
<br />
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
<br />
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
<br />
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
<br />
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
<br />
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
<br />
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
<br />
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
<br />
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
<br />
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
<br />
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
<br />
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
<br />
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
<br />
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
<br />
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
<br />
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
<br />
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
<br />
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
<br />
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
Had you such leisure in the time of death
<br />
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Methought I had; and often did I strive
<br />
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
<br />
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
<br />
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
<br />
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
<br />
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
Awaked you not with this sore agony?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
<br />
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
<br />
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
<br />
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
<br />
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
<br />
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
<br />
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
<br />
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
<br />
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
<br />
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
<br />
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
<br />
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
<br />
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
<br />
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
<br />
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
<br />
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
<br />
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
<br />
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
<br />
I trembling waked, and for a season after
<br />
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
<br />
Such terrible impression made the dream.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
<br />
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
<br />
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
<br />
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
<br />
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
<br />
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
<br />
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
<br />
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
<br />
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
<br />
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">CLARENCE sleeps</i><br />
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
<br />
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
<br />
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
<br />
An outward honour for an inward toil;
<br />
And, for unfelt imagination,
<br />
They often feel a world of restless cares:
<br />
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
<br />
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:

I'll to the king; and signify to him

That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
<br />
the judgment-day.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
<br />
of remorse in me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
What, art thou afraid?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
<br />
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
So I am, to let him live.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
<br />
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
<br />
would tell twenty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
How dost thou feel thyself now?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
<br />
thy conscience flies out.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
How if it come to thee again?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
<br />
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
<br />
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
<br />
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
<br />
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
<br />
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
<br />
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
<br />
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
<br />
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
<br />
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
<br />
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
<br />
without it.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me

Are you call'd forth from out a world of men

<br />
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?

What lawful quest have given their verdict up

Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
<br />
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
<br />
Before I be convict by course of law,
<br />
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
<br />
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
<br />
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
<br />
That you depart and lay no hands on me

The deed you undertake is damnable.

Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
<br />
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
<br />
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
<br />
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
<br />
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
<br />
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
<br />
For false forswearing and for murder too:
<br />
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
<br />
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
<br />
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
<br />
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
<br />
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
<br />
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,

He sends ye not to murder me for this
<br />
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
<br />
If God will be revenged for this deed.

O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,

Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
<br />
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
<br />
To cut off those that have offended him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
<br />
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
<br />
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
<br />
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
<br />
I am his brother, and I love him well.
<br />
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
<br />
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
<br />
Who shall reward you better for my life
<br />
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
<br />
Go you to him from me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Both</b>
Ay, so we will.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Tell him, when that our princely father York
<br />
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
<br />
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
<br />
He little thought of this divided friendship:
<br />
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Right,
<br />
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
<br />
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
<br />
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
<br />
That he would labour my delivery.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
<br />
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
<br />
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
<br />
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
<br />
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
<br />
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
<br />
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
What shall we do?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Relent, and save your souls.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
<br />
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
<br />
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
<br />
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
<br />
Would not entreat for life?
<br />
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
<br />
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
<br />
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
<br />
As you would beg, were you in my distress
<br />
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
Look behind you, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Stabs him</i><br />
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit, with the body</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
<br />
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
<br />
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter First Murderer</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
<br />
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
<br />
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
<br />
For I repent me that the duke is slain.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
<br />
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
<br />
Until the duke take order for his burial:
<br />
And when I have my meed, I must away;
<br />
For this will out, and here I must not stay.

<p>
<b class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</b>
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
<br />
Brother, we done deeds of charity;

Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,

Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,

If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
<br />
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
<br />
By any in this presence, I desire
<br />
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
<br />
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
<br />
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
<br />
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
<br />
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
<br />
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
<br />
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
<br />
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
<br />
That without desert have frown'd on me;
<br />
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
<br />
I do not know that Englishman alive
<br />
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
<br />
More than the infant that is born to-night
<br />
I thank my God for my humility.

A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:

But he, poor soul, by your first order died,

And that a winged Mercury did bear:
<br />
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,

That came too lag to see him buried.
<br />
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
<br />
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,

Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,

And yet go current from suspicion!

I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.

</p>
<p>

Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
<br />
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</b>
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
<br />
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
<br />
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
<br />
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
<br />
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
<br />
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
<br />
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
<br />
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
<br />
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
<br />
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
<br />
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
<br />
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
<br />
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
<br />
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
<br />
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
<br />
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
<br />
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
<br />
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
<br />
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
<br />
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
<br />
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
<br />
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
<br />
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
<br />
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
<br />
But for my brother not a man would speak,
<br />
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
<br />
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
<br />
Have been beholding to him in his life;
<br />
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
<br />
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
<br />
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
<br />
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
<br />
Oh, poor Clarence!

</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET</p>

<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
<br />
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
<br />
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
<br />
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
<br />
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
<br />
To comfort Edward with our company.

No, boy.

Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,

And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

Why do you look on us, and shake your head,

<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
<br />
I do lament the sickness of the king.
<br />
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
<br />
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Boy</b>
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
<br />
The king my uncle is to blame for this:

God will revenge it; whom I will importune

With daily prayers all to that effect.

Incapable and shallow innocents,

You cannot guess who caused your father's death.

Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
<br />
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
<br />
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
<br />
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
<br />
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
<br />
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
<br />
And he would love me dearly as his child.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
<br />
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
<br />
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
<br />
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow

But now two mirrors of his princely semblance

And I for comfort have but one false glass,

Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.

Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
<br />
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
<br />
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
<br />
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
<br />
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
<br />
Which would be so much the more dangerous
<br />
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
<br />
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
<br />
And may direct his course as please himself,
<br />
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
<br />
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I hope the king made peace with all of us
<br />
And the compact is firm and true in me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RIVERS</b>
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
<br />
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
<br />
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
<br />
Which haply by much company might be urged:
<br />
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
<br />
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
And so say I.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Then be it so; and go we to determine
<br />
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
<br />
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
<br />
To give your censures in this weighty business?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
With all our harts.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
<br />
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
<br />
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
<br />
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
<br />
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
<br />
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
<br />
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
<br />
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?

I promise you, I scarcely know myself:

Hear you the news abroad?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
Ay, that the king is dead.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
<br />
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter another Citizen</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
Neighbours, God speed!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
Give you good morrow, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>
<b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
In him there is a hope of government,
<br />
That in his nonage council under him,
<br />
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
<br />
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
<br />
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
<br />
For then this land was famously enrich'd
<br />
With politic grave counsel; then the king
<br />
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
Better it were they all came by the father,
<br />
Or by the father there were none at all;
<br />
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
<br />
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
<br />
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
<br />
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
<br />
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
<br />
This sickly land might solace as before.

</p>

Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.

<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
<br />
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
<br />
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
<br />
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
<br />
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
<br />
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:

Ye cannot reason almost with a man

That looks not heavily and full of fear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
Before the times of change, still is it so:

By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust

Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see

The waters swell before a boisterous storm.

But leave it all to God. whither away?

<h3>SCENE IV.  London. The palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN
ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
<br />
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
<br />
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
<br />
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
But I hear, no; they say my son of York
<br />
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
<br />
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
<br />
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
<br />
Gloucester,
<br />
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
<br />
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
<br />
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
<br />
In him that did object the same to thee;
<br />
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
<br />
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
<br />
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
<br />
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
<br />
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
<br />
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
<br />
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
<br />
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Grandam, his nurse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Pitchers have ears.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
Here comes a messenger. What news?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
How fares the prince?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
Well, madam, and in health.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
What is thy news then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
<br />
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
Who hath committed them?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
The mighty dukes
<br />
Gloucester and Buckingham.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
For what offence?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
<br />
Why or for what these nobles were committed
<br />
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
<br />
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
<br />
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
<br />
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
<br />
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
<br />
I see, as in a map, the end of all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
<br />
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
<br />
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
<br />
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
<br />
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
<br />
And being seated, and domestic broils
<br />
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
<br />
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
<br />
Self against self: O, preposterous
<br />
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
<br />
Or let me die, to look on death no more!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
<br />
Madam, farewell.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
I'll go along with you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
You have no cause.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
My gracious lady, go;
<br />
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
<br />
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
<br />
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
<br />
As well I tender you and all of yours!
<br />
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,
GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
<br />
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
<br />
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
<br />
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
<br />
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
<br />
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
<br />
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
<br />
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
<br />
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
<br />
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
<br />
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
<br />
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter the Lord Mayor and his train</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
God bless your grace with health and happy days!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
<br />
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
<br />
Would long ere this have met us on the way
<br />
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
<br />
To tell us whether they will come or no!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter HASTINGS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
<br />
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
<br />
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
<br />
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
<br />
But by his mother was perforce withheld.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
<br />
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
<br />
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
<br />
Unto his princely brother presently?
<br />
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
<br />
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CARDINAL</b>
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
<br />
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
<br />
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
<br />
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
<br />
We should infringe the holy privilege
<br />
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
<br />
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
<br />
Too ceremonious and traditional
<br />
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
<br />
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
<br />
The benefit thereof is always granted
<br />
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
<br />
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
<br />
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
<br />
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
<br />
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
<br />
You break no privilege nor charter there.
<br />
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
<br />
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CARDINAL</b>
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
<br />
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

I go, my lord.

Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.

Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
<br />
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
<br />
If I may counsel you, some day or two
<br />
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
<br />
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
<br />
For your best health and recreation.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
<br />
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
<br />
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
Is it upon record, or else reported
<br />
Successively from age to age, he built it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Upon record, my gracious lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
<br />
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
<br />
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
<br />
Even to the general all-ending day.

<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I say, without characters, fame lives long.

Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
<br />
I moralize two meanings in one word.

<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
<br />
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
<br />
His wit set down to make his valour live
<br />
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;

For now he lives in fame, though not in life.

I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
What, my gracious lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
An if I live until I be a man,

Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
<br />
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
<br />
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
<br />
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
<br />
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
He hath, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
And therefore is he idle?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Then is he more beholding to you than I.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
He may command me as my sovereign;
<br />
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
A beggar, brother?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
<br />
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
<br />
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
How?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Little.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
<br />
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
<br />
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
<br />
Because that I am little, like an ape,
<br />
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
<br />
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
<br />
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
<br />
So cunning and so young is wonderful.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
My lord, will't please you pass along?
<br />
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
<br />
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
<br />
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
My lord protector needs will have it so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Why, what should you fear?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">YORK</b>
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
<br />
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
I fear no uncles dead.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Nor none that live, I hope.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</b>
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
<br />
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
<br />
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM
and CATESBY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
<br />
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
<br />
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
<br />
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
<br />
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
<br />
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
<br />
As closely to conceal what we impart:
<br />
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
<br />
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
<br />
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
<br />
For the instalment of this noble duke
<br />
In the seat royal of this famous isle?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
<br />
That he will not be won to aught against him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
<br />
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
<br />
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
<br />
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
<br />
To sit about the coronation.
<br />
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
<br />
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
<br />
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
<br />
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
<br />
And give us notice of his inclination:
<br />
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
<br />
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
<br />
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
<br />
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
<br />
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
<br />
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
You shall, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit CATESBY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
<br />
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
<br />
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
<br />
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
<br />
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
<br />
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
<br />
We may digest our complots in some form.

What, ho! my lord!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Within</i>
Who knocks at the door?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter HASTINGS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
What is't o'clock?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
Upon the stroke of four.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
So it should seem by that I have to say.
<br />
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
And then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
And then he sends you word
<br />
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
<br />
Besides, he says there are two councils held;
<br />
And that may be determined at the one
<br />
which may make you and him to rue at the other.
<br />
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
<br />
If presently you will take horse with him,
<br />
And with all speed post with him toward the north,
<br />
To shun the danger that his soul divines.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
<br />
Bid him not fear the separated councils
<br />
His honour and myself are at the one,
<br />
And at the other is my servant Catesby
<br />
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
<br />
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
<br />
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
<br />
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
<br />
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
<br />
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
<br />
Were to incense the boar to follow us
<br />
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
<br />
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
<br />
And we will both together to the Tower,
<br />
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>

<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Many good morrows to my noble lord!

Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
<br />
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
<br />
And I believe twill never stand upright
<br />
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Ay, my good lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
<br />
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
<br />
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
<br />
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
<br />
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
<br />
That this same very day your enemies,
<br />
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
<br />
Because they have been still mine enemies:
<br />
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
<br />
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
<br />
God knows I will not do it, to the death.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
<br />
That they who brought me in my master's hate
<br />
I live to look upon their tragedy.
<br />
I tell thee, Catesby--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
What, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
<br />
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
<br />
When men are unprepared and look not for it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
<br />
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
<br />
With some men else, who think themselves as safe
<br />
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
<br />
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
The princes both make high account of you;
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Aside</i><br />
For they account his head upon the bridge.

I know they do; and I have well deserved it.

Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?

Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

<b class="speaker">STANLEY</b>
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
<br />
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,

I do not like these several councils, I.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
My lord,
<br />
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
<br />
And never in my life, I do protest,
<br />
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
<br />
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
<br />
I would be so triumphant as I am?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">STANLEY</b>
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
<br />
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
<br />
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
<br />
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
<br />
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
<br />
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
<br />
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
<br />
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD STANLEY</b>
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads

The better that your lordship please to ask.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
<br />
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
<br />
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
<br />
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
<br />
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
<br />
This day those enemies are put to death,
<br />
And I in better state than e'er I was.

Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;

Good faith, and when I met this holy man,

Those men you talk of came into my mind.

I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
<br />
I shall return before your lordship thence.

Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
<br />
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
<br />
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
<br />
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
<br />
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
<br />
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
<br />
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
<br />
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
<br />
I now repent I told the pursuivant
<br />
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
<br />
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
<br />
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
<br />
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
<br />
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RATCLIFF</b>
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:

Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
O momentary grace of mortal men,
<br />
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
<br />
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
<br />
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,

Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
<br />
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.

Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.

O bloody Richard! miserable England!

I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee

They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;

Speak and look back, and pry on every side,

Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks

Are at my service, like enforced smiles;

And both are ready in their offices,

At any time, to grace my stratagems.

The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
<br />
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
<br />
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
<br />
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
<br />
The history of all her secret thoughts:
<br />
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
<br />
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
<br />
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
<br />
He lived from all attainder of suspect.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
<br />
That ever lived.
<br />
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
<br />
Were't not that, by great preservation,
<br />
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
<br />
This day had plotted, in the council-house
<br />
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
What, had he so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
<br />
Or that we would, against the form of law,
<br />
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
<br />
But that the extreme peril of the case,
<br />
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
<br />
Enforced us to this execution?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
<br />
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
<br />
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
<br />
I never look'd for better at his hands,
<br />
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Yet had not we determined he should die,
<br />
Until your lordship came to see his death;
<br />
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
<br />
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
<br />
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
<br />
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
<br />
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
<br />
That you might well have signified the same
<br />
Unto the citizens, who haply may
<br />
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
<br />
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
<br />
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
<br />
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
<br />
With all your just proceedings in this cause.
<br />
</p>
<p>

To avoid the carping censures of the world.

But since you come too late of our intents,

Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
<br />
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
<br />
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
<br />
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
<br />
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
<br />
Only for saying he would make his son
<br />
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
<br />
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
<br />
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
<br />
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
<br />
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
<br />
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
<br />
Without control, listed to make his prey.
<br />
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
<br />
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
<br />
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
<br />
My princely father then had wars in France
<br />
And, by just computation of the time,
<br />
Found that the issue was not his begot;
<br />
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
<br />
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
<br />
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
<br />
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
<br />
</p>

Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator

This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;

That it may be this day read over in Paul's.

And mark how well the sequel hangs together:

Eleven hours I spent to write it over,

For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;

The precedent was full as long a-doing:

And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,

Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty

Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,

<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
<br />
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
<br />
And his contract by deputy in France;
<br />
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
<br />
And his enforcement of the city wives;
<br />
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
<br />
As being got, your father then in France,
<br />
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
<br />
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
<br />
Being the right idea of your father,
<br />
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
<br />
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
<br />
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
<br />
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
<br />
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
<br />
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
<br />
And when mine oratory grew to an end
<br />
I bid them that did love their country's good
<br />
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Ah! and did they so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
<br />
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
<br />
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
<br />
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
<br />
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
<br />
His answer was, the people were not wont
<br />
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
<br />
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
<br />
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
<br />
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
<br />
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
<br />
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
<br />
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
<br />
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
<br />
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
<br />
'This general applause and loving shout
<br />
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
<br />
And even here brake off, and came away.
<br />
</p>
<p>

What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?

The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
<br />
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
<br />
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
<br />
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
<br />
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
<br />
And be not easily won to our request:
<br />
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I go; and if you plead as well for them
<br />
As I can say nay to thee for myself,

To visit him to-morrow or next day:

He is within, with two right reverend fathers,

And no worldly suit would he be moved,
<br />
To draw him from his holy exercise.

Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;

Are come to have some conference with his grace.

Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
<br />
But meditating with two deep divines;
<br />
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
<br />
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
<br />
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
<br />
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
<br />
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

My lord,

He wonders to what end you have assembled
<br />
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
<br />
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
<br />
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
<br />
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
<br />
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
<br />
And so once more return and tell his grace.
<br />

And pardon us the interruption

I rather do beseech you pardon me,

Who, earnest in the service of my God,

Neglect the visitation of my friends.
<br />
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
<br />
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I do suspect I have done some offence

That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,

You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,

At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
<br />
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
<br />
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
<br />
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
<br />
The lineal glory of your royal house,
<br />
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
<br />
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
<br />
Which here we waken to our country's good,
<br />
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
<br />
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
<br />
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
<br />
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
<br />
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
<br />
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
<br />
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
<br />
And kingly government of this your land,
<br />
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
<br />
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
<br />
But as successively from blood to blood,
<br />
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
<br />
For this, consorted with the citizens,
<br />
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
<br />
And by their vehement instigation,
<br />
In this just suit come I to move your grace.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I know not whether to depart in silence,
<br />
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
<br />
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
<br />
If not to answer, you might haply think
<br />
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
<br />
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
<br />
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
<br />
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
<br />
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
<br />
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
<br />
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
<br />
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
<br />
Definitively thus I answer you.
<br />
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
<br />
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
<br />
First if all obstacles were cut away,
<br />
And that my path were even to the crown,
<br />
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
<br />
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
<br />
So mighty and so many my defects,
<br />
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
<br />
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
<br />
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
<br />
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
<br />
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
<br />
And much I need to help you, if need were;
<br />
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
<br />
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
<br />
Will well become the seat of majesty,
<br />
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
<br />
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
<br />
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
<br />
Which God defend that I should wring from him!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
<br />
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
<br />
All circumstances well considered.
<br />
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
<br />
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
<br />
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
<br />
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
<br />
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
<br />
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
<br />
These both put by a poor petitioner,
<br />
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
<br />
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
<br />
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
<br />
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
<br />
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
<br />
To base declension and loathed bigamy
<br />
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
<br />
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
<br />
More bitterly could I expostulate,
<br />
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
<br />
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
<br />
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
<br />
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
<br />
If non to bless us and the land withal,
<br />
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
<br />
From the corruption of abusing times,
<br />
Unto a lineal true-derived course.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
<br />
I am unfit for state and majesty;
<br />
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
<br />
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
<br />
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
<br />
As well we know your tenderness of heart
<br />
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
<br />
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
<br />
And egally indeed to all estates,--
<br />
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
<br />
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
<br />
But we will plant some other in the throne,
<br />
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
<br />
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
<br />
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANOTHER</b>
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
<br />
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
<br />
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
<br />
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest</i><br />
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
<br />
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
<br />
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
<br />
I must have patience to endure the load:
<br />
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
<br />
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
<br />
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
<br />
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
<br />
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
<br />
How far I am from the desire thereof.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
<br />
Long live Richard, England's royal king!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord Mayor</b>
<b class="speaker">Citizens</b>
Amen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
<br />
And so most joyfully we take our leave.
<br />

<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Come, let us to our holy task again.
<br />
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

<h3>SCENE I.  Before the Tower. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF
YORK, and DORSET; on the other, ANNE, Duchess of
Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet,
CLARENCE's young Daughter</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
<br />
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
<br />
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
<br />
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
<br />
Daughter, well met.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
God give your graces both
<br />
A happy and a joyful time of day!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
<br />
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
<br />
To gratulate the gentle princes there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter BRAKENBURY</i><br />
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
<br />
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
<br />
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
<br />
I may not suffer you to visit them;
<br />
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
The king! why, who's that?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
<br />
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
<br />
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
<br />
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
<br />
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
<br />
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter LORD STANLEY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD STANLEY</b>
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,

And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
<br />
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To LADY ANNE</i><br />
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
<br />
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
<br />
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
<br />
With this dead-killing news!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DORSET</b>
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
<br />
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
<br />
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
<br />
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
<br />
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
<br />
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
<br />
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
<br />
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
<br />
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD STANLEY</b>
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
<br />
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
<br />
You shall have letters from me to my son
<br />
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
<br />
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
<br />
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
<br />
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
<br />
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD STANLEY</b>
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
And I in all unwillingness will go.
<br />
I would to God that the inclusive verge
<br />
Of golden metal that must round my brow
<br />
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
<br />
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
<br />
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
<br />
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
<br />
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
<br />
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
<br />
Which issued from my other angel husband
<br />
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
<br />
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
<br />
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
<br />
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
<br />
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
<br />
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
<br />
As miserable by the life of thee
<br />
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
<br />
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
<br />
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
<br />
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
<br />
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
<br />
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
<br />
For never yet one hour in his bed
<br />
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
<br />
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
<br />
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
<br />
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY ANNE</b>
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To QUEEN ELIZABETH</i><br />
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
<br />
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
<br />
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
<br />
And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
<br />
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
<br />
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
<br />
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
<br />
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
<br />
For tender princes, use my babies well!
<br />
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,

To try if thou be current gold indeed

Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Say on, my loving lord.

Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'

Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:

Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;

And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
<br />
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.

Your grace may do your pleasure.

My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
<br />
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
<br />
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
<br />
The which you promised I should possess.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey

Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
What says your highness to my just demand?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
<br />
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
<br />
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
<br />
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
My lord!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
How chance the prophet could not at that time
<br />
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
<br />
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
<br />
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
<br />
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
<br />
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
My Lord!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Ay, what's o'clock?
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
<br />
Of what you promised me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Well, but what's o'clock?

Well, let it strike.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Why let it strike?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
<br />
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
<br />
I am not in the giving vein to-day.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</b>
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

<b class="speaker">TYRREL</b>
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
<br />
The most arch of piteous massacre
<br />
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
<br />
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
<br />
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
<br />
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
<br />
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
<br />
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
<br />
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
<br />
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
<br />
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
<br />
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
<br />
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
<br />
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
<br />
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
<br />
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
<br />
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
<br />
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
<br />
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
<br />
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
<br />
They could not speak; and so I left them both,

To bring this tidings to the bloody king.

Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
<br />
And be inheritor of thy desire.
<br />
Farewell till soon.

<i class="stagedir">Exit TYRREL</i><br />
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
<br />
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
<br />
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
<br />
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
<br />
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
<br />
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
<br />
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
<br />
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
<br />
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,

Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near

Come, I have heard that fearful commenting

Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary

So, now prosperity begins to mellow

And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
<br />
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
<br />
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
<br />
A dire induction am I witness to,

And will to France, hoping the consequence

Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.

If yet your gentle souls fly in the air

Hover about me with your airy wings

So many miseries have crazed my voice,

That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,

Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
<br />
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,

And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?

When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,

Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,

Brief abstract and record of tedious days,

Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,

<i class="stagedir">Sitting down with them</i><br />
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
<br />
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
<br />
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
<br />
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
<br />
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
<br />
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
<br />
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
<br />
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
<br />
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
<br />
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
<br />
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
<br />
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
<br />
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
<br />
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
<br />
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
<br />
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
<br />
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
<br />
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
<br />
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
<br />
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
<br />
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
<br />
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
<br />
Young York he is but boot, because both they
<br />
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
<br />
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
<br />
And the beholders of this tragic play,
<br />
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
<br />
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
<br />
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
<br />
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
<br />
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
<br />
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
<br />
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
<br />
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
<br />
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
<br />
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
<br />
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
<br />
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
<br />
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
<br />
The presentation of but what I was;
<br />
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
<br />
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
<br />
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
<br />
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
<br />
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
<br />
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
<br />
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
<br />
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
<br />
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
<br />
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
<br />
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
<br />
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
<br />
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
<br />
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
<br />
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
<br />
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
<br />
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
<br />
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
<br />
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
<br />
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
<br />
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
<br />
And left thee but a very prey to time;
<br />
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
<br />
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
<br />
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
<br />
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
<br />
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
<br />
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
<br />
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
<br />
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
<br />
These English woes will make me smile in France.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
<br />
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
<br />
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
<br />
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
<br />
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
<br />
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
<br />
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>

<b class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</b>
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
<br />
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.

A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;

Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
<br />
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
<br />
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
<br />
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
<br />
treacherous,
<br />
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:

Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,

Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,

Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;

Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more

My prayers on the adverse party fight;

And there the little souls of Edward's children
<br />
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
<br />
And promise them success and victory.

<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
I have no more sons of the royal blood

And therefore level not to hit their lives.

Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
And must she die for this? O, let her live,
<br />
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
<br />
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
<br />
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
<br />
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
<br />
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Her life is only safest in her birth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
And only in that safety died her brothers.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
<br />
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
<br />
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
<br />
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
<br />
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
<br />
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
<br />
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
<br />
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
<br />
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
<br />
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
<br />
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
<br />
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
<br />
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
<br />
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
<br />
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
<br />
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
<br />
As I intend more good to you and yours,
<br />
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
<br />
To be discover'd, that can do me good?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
No, to the dignity and height of honour
<br />
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
<br />
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
<br />
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
<br />
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
<br />
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
<br />
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
<br />
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
<br />
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
What do you think?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
<br />
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
<br />
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
<br />
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
<br />
And mean to make her queen of England.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
What, thou?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
How canst thou woo her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
That would I learn of you,
<br />
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
And wilt thou learn of me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Madam, with all my heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
<br />
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
<br />
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
<br />
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
<br />
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
<br />
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
<br />
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
<br />
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
<br />
If this inducement force her not to love,
<br />
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
<br />
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
<br />
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
<br />
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
<br />
To win our daughter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
There is no other way
<br />
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
<br />
And not be Richard that hath done all this.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Say that I did all this for love of her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
<br />
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
<br />
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
<br />
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
<br />
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
<br />
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
<br />
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
<br />
To quicken your increase, I will beget
<br />
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
<br />
A grandam's name is little less in love
<br />
Than is the doting title of a mother;
<br />
They are as children but one step below,
<br />
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
<br />
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
<br />
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
<br />
Your children were vexation to your youth,
<br />
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
<br />
The loss you have is but a son being king,
<br />
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
<br />
I cannot make you what amends I would,
<br />
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
<br />
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
<br />
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
<br />
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
<br />
To high promotions and great dignity:
<br />
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
<br />
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
<br />
Again shall you be mother to a king,
<br />
And all the ruins of distressful times
<br />
Repair'd with double riches of content.
<br />
What! we have many goodly days to see:
<br />
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
<br />
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
<br />
Advantaging their loan with interest
<br />
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
<br />
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
<br />
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
<br />
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
<br />
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
<br />
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
<br />
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
<br />
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
<br />
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
<br />
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
<br />
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
<br />
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
<br />
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
What were I best to say? her father's brother
<br />
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
<br />
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
<br />
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
<br />
That God, the law, my honour and her love,
<br />
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Say, I will love her everlastingly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
<br />
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
I swear--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
By nothing; for this is no oath:
<br />
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
<br />
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
<br />
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
<br />
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
<br />
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Now, by the world--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
My father's death--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Then, by myself--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Thyself thyself misusest.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Why then, by God--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
God's wrong is most of all.
<br />
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
<br />
The unity the king thy brother made
<br />
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
<br />
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
<br />
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
<br />
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
<br />
And both the princes had been breathing here,
<br />
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
<br />
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
<br />
What canst thou swear by now?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
The time to come.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
<br />
For I myself have many tears to wash
<br />
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
<br />
The children live, whose parents thou hast
<br />
slaughter'd,
<br />
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
<br />
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
<br />
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
<br />
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
<br />
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
As I intend to prosper and repent,
<br />
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
<br />
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
<br />
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
<br />
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
<br />
Be opposite all planets of good luck
<br />
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
<br />
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
<br />
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
<br />
In her consists my happiness and thine;
<br />
Without her, follows to this land and me,
<br />
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
<br />
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
<br />
It cannot be avoided but by this;
<br />
It will not be avoided but by this.
<br />
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
<br />
Be the attorney of my love to her:
<br />
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
<br />
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
<br />
Urge the necessity and state of times,
<br />
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Shall I forget myself to be myself?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
But thou didst kill my children.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
<br />
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
<br />
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</b>
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
And be a happy mother by the deed.

<p>
<b class="speaker">NORFOLK</b>
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Why, our battalion trebles that account:
<br />
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
<br />
Which they upon the adverse party want.
<br />
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
<br />
Let us survey the vantage of the field
<br />
Call for some men of sound direction

Let's want no discipline, make no delay,

For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!

The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.

What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:

Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.

Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:

Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:

Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?

Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good

That I myself have done unto myself?

O, no! alas, I rather hate myself

For hateful deeds committed by myself!
<br />
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
<br />
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
<br />
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,

And every tongue brings in a several tale,

And every tale condemns me for a villain.

Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;

I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;

Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself

Find in myself no pity to myself?

<i class="stagedir">His oration to his soldiers</i><br />
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
<br />
The leisure and enforcement of the time
<br />
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
<br />
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
<br />
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
<br />
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
<br />
Richard except, those whom we fight against
<br />
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
<br />
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
<br />
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
<br />
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
<br />
One that made means to come by what he hath,
<br />
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
<br />
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
<br />
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
<br />
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
<br />
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
<br />
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
<br />
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
<br />
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
<br />
If you do fight against your country's foes,
<br />
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
<br />
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
<br />
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
<br />
If you do free your children from the sword,
<br />
Your children's children quit it in your age.
<br />
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
<br />
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
<br />
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
<br />
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
<br />
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
<br />
The least of you shall share his part thereof.

These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
<br />
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
<br />
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
<br />
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
<br />
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
<br />
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
<br />
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
<br />
Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?
<br />
Ravish our daughters?
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Drum afar off</i><br />
Hark! I hear their drum.
<br />
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!
<br />
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
<br />
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
<br />
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter a Messenger</i><br />
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Messenger</b>
My lord, he doth deny to come.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Off with his son George's head!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">NORFOLK</b>
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
<br />
After the battle let George Stanley die.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
<br />
Advance our standards, set upon our foes
<br />
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
<br />
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
<br />
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

<h3>SCENE IV.  Another part of the field. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Alarum: excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces
fighting; to him CATESBY</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
<br />
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
<br />
Daring an opposite to every danger:
<br />
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
<br />
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
<br />
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III</p>
<p>

A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CATESBY</b>
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD III</b>
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
<br />
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
<br />
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
<br />
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
<br />
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

<h3>SCENE V.  Another part of the field. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND; they
fight. KING RICHARD III is slain. Retreat and
flourish. Re-enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the
crown, with divers other Lords</p>

<b class="speaker">RICHMOND</b>
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
<br />
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DERBY</b>
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
<br />
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
<br />
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
<br />
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
<br />
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RICHMOND</b>
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
<br />
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DERBY</b>
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
<br />
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RICHMOND</b>
What men of name are slain on either side?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DERBY</b>
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
<br />
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

<p>
<b class="speaker">RICHMOND</b>
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
<br />
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
<br />
That in submission will return to us:
<br />
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
<br />
We will unite the white rose and the red:
<br />
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
<br />
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
<br />
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
<br />
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
<br />
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
<br />
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
<br />
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
<br />
All this divided York and Lancaster,
<br />
Divided in their dire division,
<br />
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
<br />
The true succeeders of each royal house,
<br />
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
<br />
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
<br />
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
<br />
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
<br />
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
<br />
That would reduce these bloody days again,
<br />
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
<br />
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
<br />
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
<br />
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
<br />
That she may long live here, God say amen!
