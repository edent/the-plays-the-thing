<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
Now is the winter of our discontent
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
And that so lamely and unfashionable
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
Have no delight to pass away the time,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
And descant on mine own deformity:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
I am determined to prove a villain
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
To set my brother Clarence and the king
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
In deadly hate the one against the other:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
And if King Edward be as true and just
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
Clarence comes.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
<i class="stagedir">Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</i><br />
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
That waits upon your grace?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
His majesty
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-53">
Upon what cause?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
Because my name is George.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
And says a wizard told him that by G
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
His issue disinherited should be;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
And, for my name of George begins with G,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
It follows in his thought that I am he.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
Have moved his highness to commit me now.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
That tempers him to this extremity.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-79">
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-82">
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CLARENCE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
Humbly complaining to her deity
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-92">
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
If we will keep in favour with the king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
To be her men and wear her livery:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-100">
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
That no man shall have private conference,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-102">
Of what degree soever, with his brother.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-104">
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-105">
You may partake of any thing we say:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-106">
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-107">
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-109">
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-110">
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-111">
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-112">
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-114">
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-116">
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-117">
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-118">
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal

Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.

Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-130">130</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-131">
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-132">
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,

<span class="line" id="0-0-133">
I will perform it to enfranchise you.

<span class="line" id="0-0-134">
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood

<span class="line" id="0-0-135">
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;

Meantime, have patience.

I must perforce. Farewell.

<p class="stagedir">Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-145">
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-147">
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
</span>

If heaven will take the present at our hands.

But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

As much unto my good lord chamberlain!

<span class="line" id="0-0-155">
Well are you welcome to the open air.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-156">
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-158">
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-159">
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-160">
That were the cause of my imprisonment.

<span class="line" id="0-0-162">
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-163">
For they that were your enemies are his,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-164">
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-166">
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,

While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>

What news abroad?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-171">
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-172">
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-173">
And his physicians fear him mightily.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-175">
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-176">
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-177">
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-178">
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.

What, is he in his bed?

He cannot live, I hope; and must not die

Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-187">
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-188">
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;

And, if I fall not in my deep intent,

Clarence hath not another day to live:

<span class="line" id="0-0-191">
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-192">
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-193">
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-194">
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-195">
The readiest way to make the wench amends
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-196">
Is to become her husband and her father:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-197">
The which will I; not all so much for love
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-198">
As for another secret close intent,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-199">
By marrying her which I must reach unto.

But yet I run before my horse to market:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-200">200</a>

<span class="line" id="0-0-201">
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:

When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?

<span class="line" id="4-2-446">
Remember whom you are to cope withal;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-447">
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-448">
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-449">
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth

You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-453">
They would restrain the one, distain the other.

Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?

A milk-sop, one that never in his life

Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?

Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;

Lash hence these overweening rags of France,

Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,

If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,

And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
