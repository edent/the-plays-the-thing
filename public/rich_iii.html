Now is the winter of our discontent
<a class="line" href="#line-1">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-2">
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
<a class="line" href="#line-2">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-3">
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
<a class="line" href="#line-3">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-4">
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
<a class="line" href="#line-4">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-5">
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
<a class="line" href="#line-5">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-6">
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
<a class="line" href="#line-6">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-7">
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
<a class="line" href="#line-7">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-8">
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
<a class="line" href="#line-8">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-9">
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
<a class="line" href="#line-9">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-10">
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
<a class="line" href="#line-10">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-11">
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
<a class="line" href="#line-11">❦</a></span>

He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
<a class="line" href="#line-12">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-13">
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.

<span class="line" id="line-14">
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
<a class="line" href="#line-14">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-15">
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
<a class="line" href="#line-15">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-16">
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
<a class="line" href="#line-16">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-17">
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
<a class="line" href="#line-17">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-18">
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
<a class="line" href="#line-18">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-19">
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
<a class="line" href="#line-19">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-20">
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
<a class="line" href="#line-20">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-21">
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
<a class="line" href="#line-21">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-22">
And that so lamely and unfashionable
<a class="line" href="#line-22">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-23">
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
<a class="line" href="#line-23">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-24">
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
<a class="line" href="#line-24">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-25">
Have no delight to pass away the time,
<a class="line" href="#line-25">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-26">
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
<a class="line" href="#line-26">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-27">
And descant on mine own deformity:
<a class="line" href="#line-27">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-28">
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,

<span class="line" id="line-29">
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
<a class="line" href="#line-29">❦</a></span>

I am determined to prove a villain

And hate the idle pleasures of these days.

Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,

<span class="line" id="line-33">
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
<a class="line" href="#line-33">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-34">
To set my brother Clarence and the king
<a class="line" href="#line-34">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-35">
In deadly hate the one against the other:

And if King Edward be as true and just

<span class="line" id="line-37">
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,

This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
<a class="line" href="#line-38">❦</a></span>

About a prophecy, which says that 'G'

Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.

And, for my name of George begins with G,
