I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia

Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.

They were trained together in their childhoods; and

Two lads that thought there was no more behind

We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,

And bleat the one at the other: what we changed

Was innocence for innocence; we knew not

The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd

That any did. Had we pursued that life,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-110">110</a>

<span class="line" id="0-1-111">
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd

With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven

Nay, let me have't; I long.

I'll draw the curtain:

My lord's almost so far transported that

O sweet Paulina,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-107">
Make me to think so twenty years together!
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-108">
No settled senses of the world can match

<span class="line" id="4-2-109">
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

<span class="line" id="4-2-111">
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but

I could afflict you farther.

<b class="speaker">LEONTES</b>
<span class="line" id="4-2-114">
Do, Paulina;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-115">
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-116">
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-117">
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-118">
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
</span>

For I will kiss her.

Good my lord, forbear:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-122">
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-2-123">
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own

With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

No, not these twenty years.

Either forbear,

Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you

For more amazement. If you can behold it,

I'll make the statue move indeed, descend

And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--

O, peace, Paulina!

Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,

As I by thine a wife: this is a match,

As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many

And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
