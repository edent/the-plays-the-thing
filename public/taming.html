                     O Tranio, till I found it to be true,

                     Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,

                     Baptista is a noble gentleman,

                     To whom my father is not all unknown;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And were his daughter fairer than she is,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She may more suitors have and me for one.

                     Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And where two raging fires meet together
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Though little fire grows great with little wind,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So I to her and so she yields to me;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

                     Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

                     Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.

                     I did but tell her she mistook her frets,

                     And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
                  
                <br />

                     'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume

                     And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
                  
                <br />

                     And there I stood amazed for a while,

                     As on a pillory, looking through the lute;

                     While she did call me rascal fiddler

                     As had she studied to misuse me so.

                     If she be curst, it is for policy,

                     For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
                  
                <br />

                     As if the vicar meant to cozen him.

                     He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if

                     He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel

                     And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.

                     This done, he took the bride about the neck

                     And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That at the parting all the church did echo:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And after me, I know, the rout is coming.

                     Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:

                     I know you think to dine with me to-day,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
                  
                <br />

                     Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,

                     You would entreat me rather go than stay.

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For then she never looks upon her lure.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Another way I have to man my haggard,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To make her come and know her keeper's call,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As with the meat, some undeserved fault
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I'll find about the making of the bed;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That all is done in reverend care of her;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And with the clamour keep her still awake.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
                  
                <br />

                     Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And therefore, if you say no more than this,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That like a father you will deal with him
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The match is made, and all is done:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

                     It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And in no sense is meet or amiable.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty

                     Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.

                     Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And for thy maintenance commits his body
                  
                <br />

                     To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And craves no other tribute at thy hands
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But love, fair looks and true obedience;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Too little payment for so great a debt.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Such duty as the subject owes the prince

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And not obedient to his honest will,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     What is she but a foul contending rebel
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And graceless traitor to her loving lord?

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When they are bound to serve, love and obey.

                     Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
                  
                <br />

                     But that our soft conditions and our hearts
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Should well agree with our external parts?

                     To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But now I see our lances are but straws,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
                  
                <br />

                     Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
