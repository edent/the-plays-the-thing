Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,

Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
<a class="line" href="#line-2">❦</a></span>

Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,

Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,

Which then our leisure would not let us hear,

Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,

If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;

Or worthily, as a good subject should,

On some known ground of treachery in him?

As near as I could sift him on that argument,

On some apparent danger seen in him

Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

<span class="line" id="line-15">
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
<a class="line" href="#line-15">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-16">
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
<a class="line" href="#line-16">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-17">
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
<a class="line" href="#line-17">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-18">
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
<a class="line" href="#line-18">❦</a></span>

In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,

And mark my greeting well; for what I speak

My body shall make good upon this earth,

<span class="line" id="line-39">
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
<a class="line" href="#line-39">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-40">
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
<a class="line" href="#line-40">❦</a></span>

Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,

With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;

Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:

<span class="line" id="line-48">
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
<a class="line" href="#line-48">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-49">
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
<a class="line" href="#line-49">❦</a></span>

Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
<a class="line" href="#line-50">❦</a></span>

The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
<a class="line" href="#line-51">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-52">
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
<a class="line" href="#line-52">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-53">
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
<a class="line" href="#line-53">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-54">
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
<a class="line" href="#line-54">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-55">
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
<a class="line" href="#line-55">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-56">
Which else would post until it had return'd
<a class="line" href="#line-56">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-57">
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
<a class="line" href="#line-57">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-58">
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
<a class="line" href="#line-58">❦</a></span>

And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
<a class="line" href="#line-59">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-60">
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
<a class="line" href="#line-60">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-61">
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
<a class="line" href="#line-61">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-62">
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
<a class="line" href="#line-62">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-63">
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
<a class="line" href="#line-63">❦</a></span>
<span class="line" id="line-64">
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,

Or any other ground inhabitable,

Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.

Mean time let this defend my loyalty,

Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,

Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;

That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles

Besides I say and will in battle prove,

That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,

And consequently, like a traitor coward,

Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
