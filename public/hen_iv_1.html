of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</p>

<b class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
And furious close of civil butchery
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
March all one way and be no more opposed
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
We are impressed and engaged to fight,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear

<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,

<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
What yesternight our council did decree

In forwarding this dear expedience.

<b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
And many limits of the charge set down
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,

<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
A thousand of his people butchered;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
Such beastly shameless transformation,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
By those Welshwomen done as may not be

<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
Without much shame retold or spoken of.

<p>
<b class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
For more uneven and unwelcome news
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
Came from the north and thus it did import:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
At Holmedon met,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
As by discharge of their artillery,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
For he that brought them, in the very heat
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
And pride of their contention did take horse,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
Uncertain of the issue any way.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
Stain'd with the variation of each soil

<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-73">
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,

Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:

<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
And is not this an honourable spoil?
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-80">80</a>

<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

<p>
<b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>

In faith,

It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Should be the father to so blest a son,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-89">
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;

Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;

<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:

Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-98">
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-100">
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-102">
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-103">
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-105">
This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-106">
Malevolent to you in all aspects;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-107">
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up

The crest of youth against your dignity.

But I have sent for him to answer this;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-111">
And for this cause awhile we must neglect

Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.

<span class="line" id="0-0-113">
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we

But come yourself with speed to us again;

For more is to be said and to be done

<span class="line" id="0-1-3">
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-5">
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-6">
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-7">
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-8">
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-9">
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-10">
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-11">
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the

signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-13">
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-14">
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-15">
the time of the day.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-17">
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take

purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not

by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,

I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God

thou wilt have none,--

<span class="line" id="0-1-24">
What, none?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-26">
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to

prologue to an egg and butter.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-29">
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-31">
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-32">
us that are squires of the night's body be called
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-33">
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-34">
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the

<span class="line" id="0-1-35">
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-36">
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-37">
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>

Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the

fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-41">
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-42">
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-43">
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-44">
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with

swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'

<span class="line" id="0-1-46">
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder

No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,

Afford no extraordinary gaze,

But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,

Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
