                     The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,

                     And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,

                     Accoutred as I was, I plunged in

                     And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it

                     With lusty sinews, throwing it aside

                     And stemming it with hearts of controversy;

                     But ere we could arrive the point proposed,

                     Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'

                     Is now become a god, and Cassius is

                     A wretched creature and must bend his body,

                     If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.

                     He had a fever when he was in Spain,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And when the fit was on him, I did mark

                     How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     His coward lips did from their colour fly,
                  
                <br />

                     Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:

                     Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I do not know the man I should avoid

                     So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He is a great observer and he looks
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That could be moved to smile at any thing.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Such men as he be never at heart's ease

                     Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,

                     And therefore are they very dangerous.

                     Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.

                     You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life

                     Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,

                     A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,

                     Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,

                     For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:

                     Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.

                     And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,

                     Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;

                     For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When Caesar's head is off.

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Fearing to strengthen that impatience
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And could it work so much upon your shape
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,

                     Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,

                     He would embrace the means to come by it.

                     The gods do this in shame of cowardice:

                     Caesar should be a beast without a heart,

                     If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of

                     Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     was no less than his. If then that friend demand

                     why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     --Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
                  
                <br />

                     any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so

                     vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

                     I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

                     Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This was the most unkindest cut of all;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,

                     And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
                  
                <br />

                     Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,

                     Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.

                     I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,

                     And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I have no will to wander forth of doors,

                     Yet something leads me forth.

                     And partly credit things that do presage.

                     Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,

                     Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;

                     And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,

                     As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem

                     A canopy most fatal, under which
