<p class="stagedir">Enter two Gentlemen</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
Still seem as does the king.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
But what's the matter?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
That late he married--hath referr'd herself
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
Be touch'd at very heart.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
None but the king?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
Although they wear their faces to the bent
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
Glad at the thing they scowl at.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
And why so?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
For one his like, there would be something failing
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
In him that should compare. I do not think
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
So fair an outward and such stuff within
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
Endows a man but he.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
You speak him far.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
I do extend him, sir, within himself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
Crush him together rather than unfold
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
His measure duly.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
What's his name and birth?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
I cannot delve him to the root: his father
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
He served with glory and admired success,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-53">
Died with their swords in hand; for which
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
their father,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
As he was born. The king he takes the babe
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
A glass that feated them, and to the graver
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
By her election may be truly read
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
What kind of man he is.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
I honour him
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
Is she sole child to the king?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
His only child.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-79">
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-82">
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-83">
Which way they went.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
How long is this ago?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
Some twenty years.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-89">
That a king's children should be so convey'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
That could not trace them!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
Yet is it true, sir.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
I do well believe you.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,

The queen, and princess.

No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,

Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but

I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
