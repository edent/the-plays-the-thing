His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom

He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow

That late he married--hath referr'd herself

Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all

He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,

He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing

Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--

I do extend him, sir, within himself,

I cannot delve him to the root: his father

Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour

He served with glory and admired success,

So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;

Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time

Died with their swords in hand; for which

Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased

<span class="line" id="line-47">
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,

Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,

Puts to him all the learnings that his time

As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,

And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
<a class="line" href="#line-52">❦</a></span>

Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
