                     He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off

                     And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

                     They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;

                     But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To wish him wrestle with affection,

                     And never to let Beatrice know of it.

                     O god of love! I know he doth deserve
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As much as may be yielded to a man:

                     But Nature never framed a woman's heart
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;

                     Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Misprising what they look on, and her wit
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Values itself so highly that to her

                     All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,

                     Sure, I think so;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And therefore certainly it were not good

                     She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.

                     Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If low, an agate very vilely cut;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If silent, why, a block moved with none.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     So turns she every man the wrong side out
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And never gives to truth and virtue that
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

                     No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     It were a better death than die with mocks,

                     Which is as bad as die with tickling.

                     She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.

                     I know what you would say: if I have known her,

                     And I of him will gather patience.

                     Charm ache with air and agony with words:

                     No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience

                     But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To be so moral when he shall endure

                     The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:

                     My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
