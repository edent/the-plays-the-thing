Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:

Why should I war without the walls of Troy,

The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,

Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;

But I am weaker than a woman's tear,

Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,

Less valiant than the virgin in the night

And skilless as unpractised infancy.

Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,

I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will

'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the

heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must

Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,

her look, or any woman else.

I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
</span>

As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,

<span class="line" id="1-0-49">
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,

I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-51">
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:

But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,

Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.

well, go to--there were no more comparison between

the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I

O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--

When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,

Reply not in how many fathoms deep

They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad

Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me

The knife that made it.

I speak no more than truth.

Thou dost not speak so much.
