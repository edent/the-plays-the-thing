                     It is too starved a subject for my sword.

                     Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,

                     But what the repining enemy commends,

                     That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,

                     Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I love you now; but not, till now, so much
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or that we women had men's privilege
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For in this rapture I shall surely speak
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

                     But an unkind self, that itself will leave,

                     To be another's fool. I would be gone:

                     Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
                  
                <br />

                     Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out

                     Something not worth in me such rich beholding

                     How one man eats into another's pride,

                     While pride is fasting in his wantonness!

                     To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already

                     They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast

                     O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And being once subdued in armed tail,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     painted cloths.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As many as be here of pander's hall,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     It should be now, but that my fear is this,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
                  
                <br />
