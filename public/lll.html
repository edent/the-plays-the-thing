<b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>

Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
And make us heirs of all eternity.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
That war against your own affections
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
Our court shall be a little Academe,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
Still and contemplative in living art.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
That are recorded in this schedule here:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
That his own hand may strike his honour down
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
That violates the smallest branch herein:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LONGAVILLE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUMAIN</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
The grosser manner of these world's delights
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
With all these living in philosophy.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
I can but say their protestation over;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
That is, to live and study here three years.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
But there are other strict observances;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
As, not to see a woman in that term,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
And one day in a week to touch no food
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
And but one meal on every day beside,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
When I was wont to think no harm all night
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
And make a dark night too of half the day--
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-53">
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
I only swore to study with your grace
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LONGAVILLE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
What is the end of study? let me know.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-73">
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-79">
Study to break it and not break my troth.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-82">
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
These be the stops that hinder study quite
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
And train our intellects to vain delight.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-89">
As, painfully to pore upon a book
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-92">
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
Study me how to please the eye indeed
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-98">
And give him light that it was blinded by.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-100">
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
Small have continual plodders ever won
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-102">
Save base authority from others' books
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-103">
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-104">
That give a name to every fixed star
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-105">
Have no more profit of their shining nights
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-106">
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-107">
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
And every godfather can give a name.

Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,

That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

<span class="line" id="3-2-427">
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-428">
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-429">
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes

And study too, the causer of your vow;
  <a class="line" href="#3-2-430">430</a>

</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-433">
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-434">
And where we are our learning likewise is:

Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,

</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-443">
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-444">
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-445">
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-446">
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-447">
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-448">
But, with the motion of all elements,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-449">
Courses as swift as thought in every power,

</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-451">
Above their functions and their offices.
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-452">
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-453">
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-454">
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-455">
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-456">
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-457">
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-458">
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-459">
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-460">
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
  <a class="line" href="#3-2-460">460</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-461">
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-462">
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-463">
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-464">
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-465">
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-466">
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-467">
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-468">
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-469">
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-470">
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
  <a class="line" href="#3-2-470">470</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-471">
They are the books, the arts, the academes,

</span>
<span class="line" id="3-2-473">
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.

Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
