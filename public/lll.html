                     Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,                <br />
                     Live register'd upon our brazen tombs                <br />
                     And then grace us in the disgrace of death;                <br />
                     When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,                <br />
                     The endeavor of this present breath may buy                <br />
                     That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge                <br />
                     And make us heirs of all eternity.                <br />
                     Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,                <br />
                     That war against your own affections                <br />
                     And the huge army of the world's desires,--                <br />
                     Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:                <br />
                     Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;                <br />
                     Our court shall be a little Academe,                <br />
                     Still and contemplative in living art.                <br />
                     You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,                <br />
                     Have sworn for three years' term to live with me                <br />
                     My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes                <br />
                     That are recorded in this schedule here:                <br />
                     Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,                <br />
                     That his own hand may strike his honour down                <br />
                     That violates the smallest branch herein:                <br />
                     If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,                <br />
                     Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LONGAVILLE</b>
                     I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:                <br />
                     The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:                <br />
                     Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits                <br />
                     Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DUMAIN</b>
                     My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:                <br />
                     The grosser manner of these world's delights                <br />
                     He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:                <br />
                     To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;                <br />
                     With all these living in philosophy.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     I can but say their protestation over;                <br />
                     So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,                <br />
                     That is, to live and study here three years.                <br />
                     But there are other strict observances;                <br />
                     As, not to see a woman in that term,                <br />
                     Which I hope well is not enrolled there;                <br />
                     And one day in a week to touch no food                <br />
                     And but one meal on every day beside,                <br />
                     The which I hope is not enrolled there;                <br />
                     And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,                <br />
                     And not be seen to wink of all the day--                <br />
                     When I was wont to think no harm all night                <br />
                     And make a dark night too of half the day--                <br />
                     Which I hope well is not enrolled there:                <br />
                     O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,                <br />
                     Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:                <br />
                     I only swore to study with your grace                <br />
                     And stay here in your court for three years' space.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LONGAVILLE</b>
                     You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.                <br />
                     What is the end of study? let me know.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Why, that to know, which else we should not know.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Come on, then; I will swear to study so,                <br />
                     To know the thing I am forbid to know:                <br />
                     As thus,--to study where I well may dine,                <br />
                     When I to feast expressly am forbid;                <br />
                     Or study where to meet some mistress fine,                <br />
                     When mistresses from common sense are hid;                <br />
                     Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,                <br />
                     Study to break it and not break my troth.                <br />
                     If study's gain be thus and this be so,                <br />
                     Study knows that which yet it doth not know:                <br />
                     Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     These be the stops that hinder study quite                <br />
                     And train our intellects to vain delight.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,                <br />
                     Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:                <br />
                     As, painfully to pore upon a book                <br />
                     To seek the light of truth; while truth the while                <br />
                     Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:                <br />
                     Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:                <br />
                     So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,                <br />
                     Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.                <br />
                     Study me how to please the eye indeed                <br />
                     By fixing it upon a fairer eye,                <br />
                     Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed                <br />
                     And give him light that it was blinded by.                <br />
                     Study is like the heaven's glorious sun                <br />
                     That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:                <br />
                     Small have continual plodders ever won                <br />
                     Save base authority from others' books                <br />
                     These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights                <br />
                     That give a name to every fixed star                <br />
                     Have no more profit of their shining nights                <br />
                     Than those that walk and wot not what they are.                <br />
                     Too much to know is to know nought but fame;                <br />
                     And every godfather can give a name.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>

                     The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DUMAIN</b>
                     How follows that?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Fit in his place and time.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DUMAIN</b>
                     In reason nothing.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Something then in rhyme.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,                <br />
                     That bites the first-born infants of the spring.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast                <br />
                     Before the birds have any cause to sing?                <br />
                     Why should I joy in any abortive birth?                <br />
                     At Christmas I no more desire a rose                <br />
                     Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;                <br />
                     But like of each thing that in season grows.                <br />
                     So you, to study now it is too late,                <br />
                     Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:                <br />
                     And though I have for barbarism spoke more                <br />
                     Than for that angel knowledge you can say,                <br />
                     Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore                <br />
                     And bide the penance of each three years' day.                <br />
                     Give me the paper; let me read the same;                <br />
                     And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!                <br />

                     I confess both: they are both the varnish of a                <br />

                     Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of                <br />

                     It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their                <br />

                     I do affect the very ground, which is base, where                <br />
                     her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which                <br />
                     is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which                <br />
                     is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And                <br />
                     how can that be true love which is falsely                <br />
                     attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:                <br />
                     there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so                <br />
                     tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was                <br />
                     Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.                <br />
                     Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;                <br />
                     and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.                <br />
                     The first and second cause will not serve my turn;                <br />
                     the passado he respects not, the duello he regards                <br />
                     not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his                <br />
                     glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!                <br />
                     be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,                <br />
                     he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,                <br />
                     for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;                <br />
                     write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.                <br />

                     Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.                <br />

                     Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,                <br />
                     Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.                <br />
                     I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:                <br />
                     Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,                <br />
                     And sin to break it.                <br />
                     But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:                <br />
                     To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.                <br />
                     Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,                <br />
                     And suddenly resolve me in my suit.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.                <br />

                     Madam, your father here doth intimate                <br />
                     The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;                <br />
                     Being but the one half of an entire sum                <br />
                     Disbursed by my father in his wars.                <br />
                     But say that he or we, as neither have,                <br />
                     Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid                <br />
                     A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,                <br />
                     One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,                <br />
                     Although not valued to the money's worth.                <br />
                     If then the king your father will restore                <br />
                     But that one half which is unsatisfied,                <br />
                     We will give up our right in Aquitaine,                <br />
                     And hold fair friendship with his majesty.                <br />
                     But that, it seems, he little purposeth,                <br />
                     For here he doth demand to have repaid                <br />
                     A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,                <br />
                     On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,                <br />
                     To have his title live in Aquitaine;                <br />
                     Which we much rather had depart withal                <br />
                     And have the money by our father lent                <br />
                     Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.                <br />
                     Dear Princess, were not his requests so far                <br />
                     From reason's yielding, your fair self should make                <br />
                     A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast                <br />
                     And go well satisfied to France again.                <br />

                     You do the king my father too much wrong                <br />
                     And wrong the reputation of your name,                <br />
                     In so unseeming to confess receipt                <br />

                     Why, all his behaviors did make their retire                <br />
                     To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:                <br />
                     His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,                <br />
                     Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:                <br />
                     His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,                <br />
                     Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;                <br />
                     All senses to that sense did make their repair,                <br />
                     To feel only looking on fairest of fair:                <br />
                     Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,                <br />
                     As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;                <br />
                     Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,                <br />
                     Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:                <br />
                     His face's own margent did quote such amazes                <br />
                     That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.                <br />

                     I only have made a mouth of his eye,                <br />

                     love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of                <br />

                     Hark, slave, it is but this:                <br />
                     The princess comes to hunt here in the park,                <br />
                     And in her train there is a gentle lady;                <br />
                     When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,                <br />
                     And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;                <br />
                     And to her white hand see thou do commend                <br />

                     On Saturday we will return to France.                <br />
                     Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush                <br />
                     That we must stand and play the murderer in?                <br />

                     And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">Forester</b>
                     Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     What, what? first praise me and again say no?                <br />
                     O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Forester</b>
                     Yes, madam, fair.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Nay, never paint me now:                <br />
                     Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.                <br />
                     Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:                <br />
                     Fair payment for foul words is more than due.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Forester</b>
                     Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!                <br />
                     O heresy in fair, fit for these days!                <br />
                     A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.                <br />
                     But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,                <br />
                     And shooting well is then accounted ill.                <br />
                     Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:                <br />
                     Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;                <br />
                     If wounding, then it was to show my skill,                <br />
                     That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.                <br />
                     And out of question so it is sometimes,                <br />
                     Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,                <br />
                     When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,                <br />
                     We bend to that the working of the heart;                <br />
                     As I for praise alone now seek to spill                <br />
                     The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.                <br />

                     beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose                <br />
                     side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in                <br />
                     both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:                <br />
                     thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.                <br />

                     thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I                <br />
                     will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;                <br />
                     for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,                <br />
                     expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,                <br />
                     my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every                <br />

                     'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.                <br />

                     And he from forage will incline to play:                <br />

                     in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he                <br />
                     hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not                <br />
                     replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in                <br />
                     the duller parts:                <br />
                     And such barren plants are set before us, that we                <br />
                     thankful should be,                <br />
                     Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that                <br />
                     do fructify in us more than he.                <br />
                     For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,                <br />
                     So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:                <br />
                     But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,                <br />
                     Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.                <br />

                     I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.                <br />
                     The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty                <br />

                     Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made                <br />
                     sore with shooting.                <br />
                     The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps                <br />
                     from thicket;                <br />
                     Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.                <br />
                     If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores                <br />
                     one sorel.                <br />

                     foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,                <br />

                     myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in                <br />
                     a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul                <br />

                     the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well                <br />

                     I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her                <br />

                     love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing                <br />

                     heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme                <br />
                     and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,                <br />
                     and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my                <br />

                     On a day--alack the day!--                <br />
                     Love, whose month is ever May,                <br />
                     Spied a blossom passing fair                <br />
                     Playing in the wanton air:                <br />
                     Through the velvet leaves the wind,                <br />
                     All unseen, can passage find;                <br />
                     That the lover, sick to death,                <br />
                     Wish himself the heaven's breath.                <br />
                     Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;                <br />
                     Air, would I might triumph so!                <br />
                     But, alack, my hand is sworn                <br />
                     Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;                <br />
                     Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,                <br />
                     Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!                <br />
                     Do not call it sin in me,                <br />
                     That I am forsworn for thee;                <br />
                     Thou for whom Jove would swear                <br />
                     Juno but an Ethiope were;                <br />
                     And deny himself for Jove,                <br />
                     Turning mortal for thy love.                <br />
                     This will I send, and something else more plain,                <br />
                     That shall express my true love's fasting pain.                <br />

                     You chide at him, offending twice as much;                <br />
                     You do not love Maria; Longaville                <br />
                     Did never sonnet for her sake compile,                <br />

                     I have been closely shrouded in this bush                <br />

                     I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,                <br />
                     Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:                <br />
                     Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;                <br />

                     How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!                <br />

                     Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears                <br />
                     There is no certain princess that appears;                <br />

                     But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,                <br />
                     All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?                <br />

                     To see a king transformed to a gnat!                <br />

                     To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,                <br />

                     Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,                <br />

                     It mourns that painting and usurping hair                <br />
                     Should ravish doters with a false aspect;                <br />

                     And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,                <br />
                     Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.                <br />

                     Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.                <br />
                     Consider what you first did swear unto,                <br />
                     To fast, to study, and to see no woman;                <br />
                     Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.                <br />
                     Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;                <br />
                     And abstinence engenders maladies.                <br />
                     And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,                <br />
                     In that each of you have forsworn his book,                <br />
                     Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?                <br />
                     For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,                <br />
                     Have found the ground of study's excellence                <br />
                     Without the beauty of a woman's face?                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
They are the ground, the books, the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire</i><br />
                     Why, universal plodding poisons up                <br />
                     The nimble spirits in the arteries,                <br />
                     As motion and long-during action tires                <br />
                     The sinewy vigour of the traveller.                <br />
                     Now, for not looking on a woman's face,                <br />
                     You have in that forsworn the use of eyes                <br />
                     And study too, the causer of your vow;                <br />
                     For where is any author in the world                <br />
                     Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?                <br />
                     Learning is but an adjunct to ourself                <br />
                     And where we are our learning likewise is:                <br />
                     Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,                <br />
                     Do we not likewise see our learning there?                <br />
                     O, we have made a vow to study, lords,                <br />
                     And in that vow we have forsworn our books.                <br />
                     For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,                <br />
                     In leaden contemplation have found out                <br />
                     Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes                <br />
                     Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?                <br />
                     Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;                <br />
                     And therefore, finding barren practisers,                <br />
                     Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:                <br />
                     But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,                <br />
                     Lives not alone immured in the brain;                <br />
                     But, with the motion of all elements,                <br />
                     Courses as swift as thought in every power,                <br />
                     And gives to every power a double power,                <br />
                     Above their functions and their offices.                <br />
                     It adds a precious seeing to the eye;                <br />
                     A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;                <br />
                     A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,                <br />
                     When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:                <br />
                     Love's feeling is more soft and sensible                <br />
                     Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;                <br />
                     Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:                <br />
                     For valour, is not Love a Hercules,                <br />
                     Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?                <br />
                     Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical                <br />
                     As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:                <br />
                     And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods                <br />
                     Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.                <br />
                     Never durst poet touch a pen to write                <br />
                     Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;                <br />
                     O, then his lines would ravish savage ears                <br />
                     And plant in tyrants mild humility.                <br />
                     From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:                <br />
                     They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;                <br />
                     They are the books, the arts, the academes,                <br />
                     That show, contain and nourish all the world:                <br />
                     Else none at all in ought proves excellent.                <br />
                     Then fools you were these women to forswear,                <br />
                     Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.                <br />
                     For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,                <br />
                     Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,                <br />
                     Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,                <br />
                     Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,                <br />
                     Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,                <br />
                     Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.                <br />
                     It is religion to be thus forsworn,                <br />
                     For charity itself fulfills the law,                <br />
                     And who can sever love from charity?                <br />

                     the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do                <br />

                     Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,                <br />
                     I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is                <br />
                     inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,                <br />
                     remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy                <br />
                     head: and among other important and most serious                <br />
                     designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let                <br />
                     that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his                <br />
                     grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor                <br />

                     fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his                <br />
                     greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of                <br />

                     The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do                <br />
                     implore secrecy,--that the king would have me                <br />

                     I were the fairest goddess on the ground:                <br />
                     I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.                <br />

                     A huge translation of hypocrisy,                <br />

                     How I would make him fawn and beg and seek                <br />
                     And wait the season and observe the times                <br />

                     And make him proud to make me proud that jests!                <br />
                     So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state                <br />

                     Under the cool shade of a sycamore                <br />
                     I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;                <br />
                     When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,                <br />
                     Toward that shade I might behold addrest                <br />
                     The king and his companions: warily                <br />
                     I stole into a neighbour thicket by,                <br />
                     And overheard what you shall overhear,                <br />
                     That, by and by, disguised they will be here.                <br />
                     Their herald is a pretty knavish page,                <br />
                     That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:                <br />
                     Action and accent did they teach him there;                <br />
                     'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'                <br />
                     And ever and anon they made a doubt                <br />
                     Presence majestical would put him out,                <br />
                     'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;                <br />
                     Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'                <br />
                     The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;                <br />
                     I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'                <br />
                     With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,                <br />
                     Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:                <br />
                     One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore                <br />
                     A better speech was never spoke before;                <br />
                     Another, with his finger and his thumb,                <br />
                     Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'                <br />
                     The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'                <br />
                     The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.                <br />
                     With that, they all did tumble on the ground,                <br />
                     With such a zealous laughter, so profound,                <br />
                     That in this spleen ridiculous appears,                <br />
                     To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.                <br />

                     They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.                <br />
                     Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.                <br />
                     Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;                <br />
                     And every one his love-feat will advance                <br />
                     Unto his several mistress, which they'll know                <br />
                     By favours several which they did bestow.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;                <br />
                     For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;                <br />
                     And not a man of them shall have the grace,                <br />
                     Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.                <br />
                     Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,                <br />
                     And then the king will court thee for his dear;                <br />
                     Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,                <br />
                     So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.                <br />
                     And change your favours too; so shall your loves                <br />
                     Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KATHARINE</b>
                     But in this changing what is your intent?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:                <br />
                     They do it but in mocking merriment;                <br />
                     And mock for mock is only my intent.                <br />
                     Their several counsels they unbosom shall                <br />
                     To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal                <br />
                     Upon the next occasion that we meet,                <br />
                     With visages displayed, to talk and greet.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     But shall we dance, if they desire to't?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     No, to the death, we will not move a foot;                <br />
                     Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,                <br />
                     But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BOYET</b>
                     Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,                <br />
                     And quite divorce his memory from his part.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt                <br />
                     The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out                <br />
                     There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,                <br />
                     To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:                <br />
                     So shall we stay, mocking intended game,                <br />
                     And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.                <br />

                     It is not so. Ask them how many inches                <br />
                     Is in one mile: if they have measured many,                <br />

          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Construe my speeches better, if you may.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Then wish me better; I will give you leave.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     We came to visit you, and purpose now                <br />
                     To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:                <br />
                     Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:                <br />
                     The virtue of your eye must break my oath.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;                <br />
                     For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.                <br />
                     Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure                <br />
                     As the unsullied lily, I protest,                <br />
                     A world of torments though I should endure,                <br />
                     I would not yield to be your house's guest;                <br />
                     So much I hate a breaking cause to be                <br />
                     Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     O, you have lived in desolation here,                <br />
                     Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;                <br />
                     We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:                <br />
                     A mess of Russians left us but of late.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     How, madam! Russians!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Ay, in truth, my lord;                <br />
                     Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:                <br />
                     My lady, to the manner of the days,                <br />
                     In courtesy gives undeserving praise.                <br />
                     We four indeed confronted were with four                <br />
                     In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,                <br />
                     And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,                <br />
                     They did not bless us with one happy word.                <br />
                     I dare not call them fools; but this I think,                <br />
                     When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,                <br />
                     Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,                <br />
                     With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,                <br />
                     By light we lose light: your capacity                <br />
                     Is of that nature that to your huge store                <br />
                     Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     I am a fool, and full of poverty.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     But that you take what doth to you belong,                <br />
                     It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     O, I am yours, and all that I possess!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     All the fool mine?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     I cannot give you less.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     Which of the vizards was it that you wore?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case                <br />
                     That hid the worse and show'd the better face.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DUMAIN</b>
                     Let us confess and turn it to a jest.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?                <br />
                     Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.                <br />
                     Can any face of brass hold longer out?                <br />
                     Here stand I lady, dart thy skill at me;                <br />
                     Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;                <br />
                     Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;                <br />
                     Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;                <br />
                     And I will wish thee never more to dance,                <br />
                     Nor never more in Russian habit wait.                <br />
                     O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,                <br />
                     Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,                <br />
                     Nor never come in vizard to my friend,                <br />
                     Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!                <br />
                     Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,                <br />
                     Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,                <br />
                     Figures pedantical; these summer-flies                <br />
                     Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:                <br />
                     I do forswear them; and I here protest,                <br />
                     By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--                <br />
                     Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd                <br />
                     In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:                <br />
                     And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--                <br />
                     My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     Sans sans, I pray you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Yet I have a trick                <br />
                     Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;                <br />
                     I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:                <br />
                     Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;                <br />
                     They are infected; in their hearts it lies;                <br />
                     They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;                <br />
                     These lords are visited; you are not free,                <br />
                     For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     It is not so; for how can this be true,                <br />
                     That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Peace! for I will not have to do with you.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ROSALINE</b>
                     Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BIRON</b>
                     Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression                <br />
                     Some fair excuse.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     The fairest is confession.                <br />
                     Were not you here but even now disguised?                <br />

                     Madam, I was.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     And were you well advised?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     I was, fair madam.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     When you then were here,                <br />
                     What did you whisper in your lady's ear?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     That more than all the world I did respect her.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Upon mine honour, no.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     Peace, peace! forbear:                <br />
                     Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FERDINAND</b>
                     Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCESS</b>
                     I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,                <br />
                     What did the Russian whisper in your ear?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>

                     Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,                <br />
                     Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,                <br />

                     To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,                <br />
                     Told our intents before; which once disclosed,                <br />
                     The ladies did change favours: and then we,                <br />
                     Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.                <br />

                     The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty                <br />
                     Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;                <br />
                     A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea                <br />
                     From morn till night, out of his pavilion.                <br />

                     Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,                <br />

                     Our love being yours, the error that love makes                <br />
                     Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,                <br />
                     By being once false for ever to be true                <br />
                     To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:                <br />
                     And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,                <br />
                     Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.                <br />

                     No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,                <br />
                     Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:                <br />
                     If for my love, as there is no such cause,                <br />

                     To some forlorn and naked hermitage,                <br />
                     Remote from all the pleasures of the world;                <br />
                     There stay until the twelve celestial signs                <br />
                     Have brought about the annual reckoning.                <br />

                     If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds                <br />
                     Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,                <br />
                     But that it bear this trial and last love;                <br />
                     Then, at the expiration of the year,                <br />
                     Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,                <br />
                     And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine                <br />
                     I will be thine; and till that instant shut                <br />
                     My woeful self up in a mourning house,                <br />
                     Raining the tears of lamentation                <br />
                     For the remembrance of my father's death.                <br />

                     esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that                <br />
                     the two learned men have compiled in praise of the                <br />
                     owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the                <br />
                     end of our show.                <br />

                     This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;                <br />
                     the one maintained by the owl, the other by the                <br />
                     cuckoo. Ver, begin.                <br />

                     When daisies pied and violets blue                <br />
                     And lady-smocks all silver-white                <br />
                     And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue                <br />
                     Do paint the meadows with delight,                <br />
                     The cuckoo then, on every tree,                <br />
                     Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;                <br />
                     Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,                <br />
                     Unpleasing to a married ear!                <br />
                     When shepherds pipe on oaten straws                <br />
                     And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,                <br />
                     When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,                <br />
                     And maidens bleach their summer smocks                <br />
                     The cuckoo then, on every tree,                <br />

                     When icicles hang by the wall                <br />
                     And Dick the shepherd blows his nail                <br />
                     And Tom bears logs into the hall                <br />
                     And milk comes frozen home in pail,                <br />
                     When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,                <br />
                     Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;                <br />
                     Tu-who, a merry note,                <br />
                     While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.                <br />
                     When all aloud the wind doth blow                <br />
                     And coughing drowns the parson's saw                <br />
                     And birds sit brooding in the snow                <br />
                     And Marian's nose looks red and raw,                <br />
                     When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,                <br />
                     Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;                <br />
                     Tu-who, a merry note,                <br />
