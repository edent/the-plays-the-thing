<div class="scene">
<h3>SCENE I.  DUKE ORSINO's palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords;
Musicians attending</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
If music be the food of love, play on;
<br />
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
<br />
The appetite may sicken, and so die.
<br />
That strain again! it had a dying fall:
<br />
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
<br />
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
<br />
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
<br />
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
<br />
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
<br />
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
<br />
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
<br />
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
<br />
But falls into abatement and low price,
<br />
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
<br />
That it alone is high fantastical.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CURIO</b>
Will you go hunt, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
What, Curio?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CURIO</b>
The hart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
<br />
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
<br />
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
<br />
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
<br />
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
<br />
E'er since pursue me.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter VALENTINE</i><br />
How now! what news from her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VALENTINE</b>
So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
<br />
But from her handmaid do return this answer:
<br />
The element itself, till seven years' heat,
<br />
Shall not behold her face at ample view;
<br />
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
<br />
And water once a day her chamber round
<br />
With eye-offending brine: all this to season
<br />
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
<br />
And lasting in her sad remembrance.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
<br />
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
<br />
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
<br />
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
<br />
That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
<br />
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
<br />
Her sweet perfections with one self king!
<br />
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
<br />
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
<br />

<h3>SCENE II.  The sea-coast. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
What country, friends, is this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
This is Illyria, lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
And what should I do in Illyria?
<br />
My brother he is in Elysium.
<br />
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
<br />
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
<br />
When you and those poor number saved with you
<br />
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
<br />
Most provident in peril, bind himself,
<br />
Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
<br />
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
<br />
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
<br />
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
<br />
So long as I could see.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
For saying so, there's gold:
<br />
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
<br />
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
<br />
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
<br />
Not three hours' travel from this very place.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Who governs here?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
A noble duke, in nature as in name.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
What is the name?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
Orsino.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
<br />
He was a bachelor then.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
And so is now, or was so very late;
<br />
For but a month ago I went from hence,
<br />
And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
<br />
What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
<br />
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
What's she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
<br />
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
<br />
In the protection of his son, her brother,
<br />
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
<br />
They say, she hath abjured the company
<br />
And sight of men.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
O that I served that lady
<br />
And might not be delivered to the world,
<br />
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
<br />
What my estate is!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
That were hard to compass;
<br />
Because she will admit no kind of suit,
<br />
No, not the duke's.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
<br />
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
<br />
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
<br />
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
<br />
With this thy fair and outward character.
<br />
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
<br />
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
<br />
For such disguise as haply shall become
<br />
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
<br />
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
<br />
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
<br />
And speak to him in many sorts of music
<br />
That will allow me very worth his service.
<br />
What else may hap to time I will commit;
<br />
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
<br />
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I thank thee: lead me on.
<br />

<h3>SCENE III.  OLIVIA'S house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
<br />
her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
<br />
nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
<br />
exceptions to your ill hours.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Why, let her except, before excepted.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
<br />
limits of order.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
<br />
these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
<br />
these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
<br />
themselves in their own straps.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
<br />
my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
<br />
knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Ay, he.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
What's that to the purpose?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
<br />
he's a very fool and a prodigal.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
<br />
viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
<br />
word for word without book, and hath all the good
<br />
gifts of nature.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
<br />
he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
<br />
he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
<br />
hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
<br />
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
<br />
that say so of him. Who are they?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
<br />
her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
<br />
drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
<br />
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
<br />
o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
<br />
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter SIR ANDREW</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Sweet Sir Andrew!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Bless you, fair shrew.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
And you too, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
What's that?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
My niece's chambermaid.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
My name is Mary, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
<br />
her, woo her, assail her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
<br />
company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Fare you well, gentlemen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
<br />
never draw sword again.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
<br />
draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
<br />
fools in hand?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
<br />
your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
It's dry, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
<br />
keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
A dry jest, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Are you full of them?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
<br />
now I let go your hand, I am barren.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
<br />
see thee so put down?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
<br />
put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
<br />
than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
<br />
great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
No question.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
<br />
to-morrow, Sir Toby.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Pourquoi, my dear knight?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
<br />
bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
<br />
fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
<br />
followed the arts!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Why, would that have mended my hair?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
<br />
hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
<br />
and spin it off.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
<br />
will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
<br />
she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
<br />
her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
<br />
have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
<br />
man.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
<br />
strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
<br />
and revels sometimes altogether.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
<br />
degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
<br />
with an old man.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Faith, I can cut a caper.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
And I can cut the mutton to't.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
<br />
as any man in Illyria.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
<br />
these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
<br />
take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
<br />
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
<br />
a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
<br />
so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
<br />
dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
<br />
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
<br />
leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
<br />
flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Taurus! That's sides and heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
<br />
caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
<br />

If the duke continue these favours towards you,

known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
<br />
</p>

On your attendance, my lord; here.

<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
<br />
Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
<br />
To thee the book even of my secret soul:
<br />
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
<br />
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
<br />
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
<br />
Till thou have audience.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Sure, my noble lord,
<br />
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
<br />
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
<br />
Rather than make unprofited return.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
O, then unfold the passion of my love,
<br />
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
<br />
It shall become thee well to act my woes;
<br />
She will attend it better in thy youth
<br />
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I think not so, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Dear lad, believe it;
<br />
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
<br />
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
<br />
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
<br />
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
<br />
And all is semblative a woman's part.
<br />
I know thy constellation is right apt
<br />
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
<br />
All, if you will; for I myself am best
<br />
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
<br />
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
<br />
To call his fortunes thine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I'll do my best
<br />
To woo your lady:

<h3>SCENE V.  OLIVIA'S house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter MARIA and Clown</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
<br />
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
<br />
way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this

world needs to fear no colours.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Make that good.
<br />
</p>
<p>

He shall see none to fear.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Where, good Mistress Mary?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
<br />
that are fools, let them use their talents.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
<br />
to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?

</p>
<p>

Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,

<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
You are resolute, then?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both

break, your gaskins fall.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
<br />
Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
<br />
piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my

lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.

<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>

<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
<br />
Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
<br />
prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
<br />
pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
<br />
'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO</i><br />
God bless thee, lady!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Take the fool away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
<br />
besides, you grow dishonest.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
<br />
will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
<br />
the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
<br />
himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
<br />
he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
<br />
that's mended is but patched: virtue that
<br />
transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
<br />
amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
<br />
simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
<br />
what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
<br />
calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
<br />
away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Sir, I bade them take away you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
<br />
facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
<br />
motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
<br />
prove you a fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Can you do it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Dexterously, good madonna.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Make your proof.
<br />
</p>
<p>

I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
<br />
of virtue, answer me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Good madonna, why mournest thou?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Good fool, for my brother's death.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
<br />
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
<br />
infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
<br />
better fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
<br />
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
<br />
sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
<br />
word for two pence that you are no fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
How say you to that, Malvolio?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
<br />
barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
<br />
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
<br />
than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
<br />
already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
<br />
him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
<br />
that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
<br />
than the fools' zanies.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
<br />
with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
<br />
guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
<br />
things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
<br />
there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
<br />
nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
<br />
man, though he do nothing but reprove.

Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but

madman: fie on him!

Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I

am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.

Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
<br />
people dislike it.

Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest

most weak pia mater.

Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?

Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my

Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
<br />
you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
<br />
understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
<br />
with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
<br />
have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
<br />
comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
<br />
lady? he's fortified against any denial.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
What kind o' man is he?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Why, of mankind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
What manner of man?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Of what personage and years is he?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
<br />
a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
<br />
cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
<br />
in standing water, between boy and man. He is very

well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one

Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
<br />
Your will?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
<br />
pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
<br />
for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
<br />
my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
<br />
penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
<br />
beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
<br />
comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Whence came you, sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I can say little more than I have studied, and that
<br />
question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
<br />
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
<br />
that I may proceed in my speech.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Are you a comedian?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
<br />
of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you

the lady of the house?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
If I do not usurp myself, I am.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
<br />
yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
<br />
to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
<br />
on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
<br />
the heart of my message.
<br />
</p>
<p>

Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
<br />
keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
<br />
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
<br />
than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
<br />
you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of

moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.

<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little

<br />
lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
<br />
the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
<br />
war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my

hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
<br />
learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I

divinity, to any other's, profanation.

<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
<br />
Where lies your text?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
In Orsino's bosom.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Good madam, let me see your face.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
<br />
with my face? You are now out of your text: but
<br />
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
<br />
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
<br />
not well done?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Unveiling</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Excellently done, if God did all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
<br />
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
<br />
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
<br />
If you will lead these graces to the grave
<br />
And leave the world no copy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
<br />
out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
<br />
inventoried, and every particle and utensil
<br />
labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
<br />
indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
<br />
them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
<br />
you sent hither to praise me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I see you what you are, you are too proud;
<br />
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
<br />
My lord and master loves you: O, such love
<br />
Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
<br />
The nonpareil of beauty!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
How does he love me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
With adorations, fertile tears,
<br />
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
<br />
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
<br />
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
<br />
In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
<br />
And in dimension and the shape of nature
<br />
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
<br />
He might have took his answer long ago.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
If I did love you in my master's flame,
<br />
With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
<br />
In your denial I would find no sense;
<br />
I would not understand it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Why, what would you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
<br />
And call upon my soul within the house;
<br />
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
<br />
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
<br />
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
<br />
And make the babbling gossip of the air
<br />
Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
<br />
Between the elements of air and earth,
<br />
But you should pity me!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
You might do much.
<br />
What is your parentage?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
<br />
I am a gentleman.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Get you to your lord;
<br />
I cannot love him: let him send no more;
<br />
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
<br />
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
<br />
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
<br />
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
<br />
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
<br />
And let your fervor, like my master's, be
<br />
Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
<br />
</p>
<p>

By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
<br />
me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
<br />
distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your

leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad

Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.

<p>
<b class="speaker">SEBASTIAN</b>
No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
<br />
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
<br />
touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
<br />
what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
<br />
me in manners the rather to express myself. You
<br />
must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
<br />
which I called Roderigo. My father was that
<br />
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
<br />
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
<br />
born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
<br />
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
<br />
for some hour before you took me from the breach of

the sea was my sister drowned.

Alas the day!

overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly

O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

If you will not undo what you have done, that is,

kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.

Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,

and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that

upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell

tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since

She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
<br />
saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
<br />
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
<br />
into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
<br />
and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
<br />
come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
<br />
your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her

will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth

it his that finds it.

I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
<br />
Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
<br />
She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
<br />
That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
<br />
For she did speak in starts distractedly.
<br />
She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
<br />
Invites me in this churlish messenger.
<br />
None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
<br />
I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
<br />
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
<br />
Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
<br />
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
<br />
How easy is it for the proper-false
<br />
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
<br />
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
<br />
For such as we are made of, such we be.
<br />
How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
<br />
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
<br />
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
<br />
What will become of this? As I am man,
<br />
My state is desperate for my master's love;
<br />
As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
<br />
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

O time! thou must untangle this, not I;

It is too hard a knot for me to untie!

A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.

To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is

Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the

I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason

The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing

swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
<br />
crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is

his grounds of faith that all that look on him love

him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find

What wilt thou do?

love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
<br />
of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
<br />
of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
<br />
himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
<br />
like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
<br />
can hardly make distinction of our hands.

love with him.

My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
<br />
O, prepare it!
<br />
My part of death, no one so true
<br />
Did share it.
<br />
Not a flower, not a flower sweet
<br />
On my black coffin let there be strown;
<br />
Not a friend, not a friend greet
<br />
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
<br />
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
<br />
Lay me, O, where
<br />
Sad true lover never find my grave,
<br />
To weep there!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
There's for thy pains.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
I'll pay thy pleasure then.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Give me now leave to leave thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
<br />
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
<br />
thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
<br />
constancy put to sea, that their business might be
<br />
every thing and their intent every where; for that's
<br />
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Let all the rest give place.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">CURIO and Attendants retire</i><br />
Once more, Cesario,
<br />
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
<br />
Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
<br />
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
<br />
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
<br />
Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
<br />
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
<br />
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
But if she cannot love you, sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
I cannot be so answer'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Sooth, but you must.
<br />
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
<br />
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
<br />
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
<br />
You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
There is no woman's sides
<br />
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
<br />
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
<br />
So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
<br />
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
<br />
No motion of the liver, but the palate,
<br />
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
<br />
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
<br />
And can digest as much: make no compare
<br />
Between that love a woman can bear me
<br />
And that I owe Olivia.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Ay, but I know--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
What dost thou know?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Too well what love women to men may owe:
<br />
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
<br />
My father had a daughter loved a man,
<br />
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
<br />
I should your lordship.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
And what's her history?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
<br />
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
<br />
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
<br />
And with a green and yellow melancholy
<br />
She sat like patience on a monument,
<br />
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
<br />
We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
<br />
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
<br />
Much in our vows, but little in our love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I am all the daughters of my father's house,
<br />
And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
<br />
Sir, shall I to this lady?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Ay, that's the theme.
<br />
To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
<br />
My love can give no place, bide no denay.

Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,

Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly

I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will

fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

How now, my metal of India!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
<br />
coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
<br />
sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
<br />
hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
<br />
know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
<br />
him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,

<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
<br />
me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
<br />
thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one

of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
<br />
exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
<br />
What should I think on't?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Here's an overweening rogue!

O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock

of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!

'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Pistol him, pistol him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Peace, peace!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
<br />
married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Fie on him, Jezebel!
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how

imagination blows him.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Having been three months married to her, sitting in
<br />
my state,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet

gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
<br />
Olivia sleeping,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Fire and brimstone!
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
O, peace, peace!

<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
And then to have the humour of state; and after a

demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
<br />
place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
<br />
kinsman Toby,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Bolts and shackles!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
<br />
out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
<br />
up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
<br />
approaches; courtesies there to me,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Shall this fellow live?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.

<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar

smile with an austere regard of control,--

And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
<br />

'You must amend your drunkenness.'

<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Out, scab!

<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.

'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with

a foolish knight,'--

That's me, I warrant you.

<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Excellent wench, say I.

<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command

me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is

evident to any formal capacity; there is no

<br />
and in this she manifests herself to my love, and

with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
<br />

be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and

So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a

You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is

wrong side may be turned outward!

Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with

I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Why, man?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that

word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words

are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Thy reason, man?

Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and

words are grown so false, I am loath to prove

reason with them.

<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my

conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be

to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.

<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she

fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
<br />
it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
<br />
the fool should be as oft with your master as with
<br />
my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
<br />
Hold, there's expenses for thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
<br />
one;
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Aside</i><br />
though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
<br />
lady within?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Yes, being kept together and put to use.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
<br />
a Cressida to this Troilus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Clown</b>
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
<br />
a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
<br />
within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
<br />
come; who you are and what you would are out of my
<br />
welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
<br />
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
<br />
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
<br />
The quality of persons, and the time,
<br />
And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
<br />
That comes before his eye. This is a practise
<br />
As full of labour as a wise man's art
<br />
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
<br />
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

My duty, madam, and most humble service.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
What is your name?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
<br />
Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
<br />
You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
<br />
Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
<br />
Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
<br />
On his behalf.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
O, by your leave, I pray you,
<br />
I bade you never speak again of him:
<br />
But, would you undertake another suit,
<br />
I had rather hear you to solicit that
<br />
Than music from the spheres.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Dear lady,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
<br />
After the last enchantment you did here,
<br />
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
<br />
Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
<br />
Under your hard construction must I sit,
<br />
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
<br />
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
<br />
Have you not set mine honour at the stake
<br />
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
<br />
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
<br />
Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
<br />
Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I pity you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
That's a degree to love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
<br />
That very oft we pity enemies.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
<br />
O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
<br />
If one should be a prey, how much the better
<br />
To fall before the lion than the wolf!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Clock strikes</i><br />
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
<br />
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
<br />
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
<br />
Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
<br />
There lies your way, due west.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
<br />
Attend your ladyship!
<br />
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Stay:
<br />
I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
That you do think you are not what you are.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
If I think so, I think the same of you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Then think you right: I am not what I am.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
I would you were as I would have you be!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
Would it be better, madam, than I am?
<br />
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
<br />
In the contempt and anger of his lip!
<br />
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
<br />
Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
<br />
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
<br />
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
<br />
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
<br />
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
<br />
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
<br />
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
<br />
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
<br />
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
By innocence I swear, and by my youth
<br />
I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
<br />
And that no woman has; nor never none
<br />
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
<br />
And so adieu, good madam: never more
<br />
Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
<br />
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
<br />

<h3>SCENE II.  OLIVIA's house. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
<br />
count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
<br />
I saw't i' the orchard.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
As plain as I see you now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
<br />
judgment and reason.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
<br />
was a sailor.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
<br />
to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
<br />
put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
<br />
You should then have accosted her; and with some
<br />
excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
<br />
have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
<br />
looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
<br />
double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
<br />
off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
<br />
lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
<br />
on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
<br />
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
<br />
I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
<br />
politician.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
<br />
valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
<br />
with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
<br />
take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
<br />
love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
<br />
commendation with woman than report of valour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
<br />
it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
<br />
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
<br />
if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
<br />
amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
<br />
paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
<br />
bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
<br />
Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
<br />
write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR ANDREW</b>
Where shall I find you?

We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.

<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
<br />

<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
<br />
strong, or so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
<br />
not deliver't?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
<br />
youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
<br />
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
<br />
opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
<br />
will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
<br />
the anatomy.
<br />
</p>

great presage of cruelty.

If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself

turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no

rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages

And cross-gartered?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARIA</b>
Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
<br />
i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
<br />
murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
<br />
that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
<br />
face into more lines than is in the new map with the
<br />
augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
<br />
a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
<br />
at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
<br />
he'll smile and take't for a great favour.

I would not by my will have troubled you;

But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
<br />
I will no further chide you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
I could not stay behind you: my desire,
<br />
More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
<br />
And not all love to see you, though so much
<br />
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
<br />
But jealousy what might befall your travel,
<br />
Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
<br />
Unguided and unfriended, often prove
<br />
Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
<br />
The rather by these arguments of fear,

Set forth in your pursuit.

<b class="speaker">SEBASTIAN</b>
My kind Antonio,

I can no other answer make but thanks,
<br />
And thanks; and ever oft good turns
<br />
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
<br />
But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
<br />
You should find better dealing. What's to do?
<br />
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
<br />
</p>
<p>

To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.

I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:

I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
<br />
With the memorials and the things of fame
<br />
That do renown this city.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Would you'ld pardon me;
<br />
I do not without danger walk these streets:
<br />
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
<br />
I did some service; of such note indeed,
<br />
That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SEBASTIAN</b>
Belike you slew great number of his people.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
<br />
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
<br />
Might well have given us bloody argument.
<br />
It might have since been answer'd in repaying
<br />
What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
<br />
Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
<br />
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
<br />
I shall pay dear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SEBASTIAN</b>
Do not then walk too open.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
<br />
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
<br />
Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,

Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
<br />
With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.

<p>
<b class="speaker">SEBASTIAN</b>
Why I your purse?
<br />
</p>

Haply your eye shall light upon some toy

You have desire to purchase; and your store,

I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you

For an hour.

I have sent after him: he says he'll come;

For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.

I speak too loud.

And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:

No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your

Smilest thou?

Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some

obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but

Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's

my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special

half of my dowry.

<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
<br />
Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
<br />
the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
<br />
appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
<br />
in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
<br />
'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
<br />
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
<br />
thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
<br />
consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
<br />
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
<br />
habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
<br />
limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
<br />
thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
<br />
fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
<br />
after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
<br />
adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
<br />
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
<br />
or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
<br />
that can be can come between me and the full
<br />
prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
<br />
doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel

He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on

brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
<br />
his incensement at this moment is so implacable,

of that quirk.

Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a

very competent injury: therefore, get you on and

give him his desire. Back you shall not to the

house, unless you undertake that with me which with
<br />
as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
<br />
or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you

must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.

<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
<br />
this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
<br />
my offence to him is: it is something of my

<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?

<p>
<b class="speaker">FABIAN</b>
Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by

his form, as you are like to find him in the proof

bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly

I hate ingratitude more in a man
<br />
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
<br />
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
<br />
Inhabits our frail blood.

O heavens themselves!

<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Officer</b>
Come, sir, I pray you, go.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
<br />
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
<br />
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
<br />
And to his image, which methought did promise
<br />
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Officer</b>
What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
But O how vile an idol proves this god
<br />
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
<br />
In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
<br />
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
<br />
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
<br />
Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Officer</b>
The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.

Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
<br />
That he believes himself: so do not I.

Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
<br />
That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll

He named Sebastian: I my brother know
<br />
Yet living in my glass; even such and so
<br />
In favour was my brother, and he went
<br />
Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
<br />
For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
<br />
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SIR TOBY BELCH</b>
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than

<br />
his cowardship, ask Fabian.

To any other trust but that I am mad

You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:

Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.

<p class="stagedir">Enter ANTONIO and Officers</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
That face of his I do remember well;
<br />
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
<br />
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
<br />
A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
<br />
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
<br />
With which such scathful grapple did he make
<br />
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
<br />
That very envy and the tongue of loss
<br />
Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Officer</b>
Orsino, this is that Antonio
<br />
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
<br />
And this is he that did the Tiger board,
<br />
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
<br />
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
<br />
In private brabble did we apprehend him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
<br />
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
<br />
I know not what 'twas but distraction.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
<br />
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
<br />
Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
<br />
Hast made thine enemies?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTONIO</b>
Orsino, noble sir,
<br />
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
<br />
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
<br />
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
<br />
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
<br />
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
<br />
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
<br />
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
<br />
His life I gave him and did thereto add
<br />
My love, without retention or restraint,
<br />
All his in dedication; for his sake
<br />
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
<br />
Into the danger of this adverse town;
<br />
Drew to defend him when he was beset:
<br />
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
<br />
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
<br />
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
<br />
And grew a twenty years removed thing
<br />
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
<br />
Which I had recommended to his use
<br />
Not half an hour before.
<br />
</p>
<p>

To-day, my lord; and for three months before,

No interim, not a minute's vacancy,

Both day and night did we keep company.

My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,

It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear

As howling after music.

<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>

Still so constant, lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
<br />
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
<br />
My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
<br />
That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE ORSINO</b>
Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
<br />
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
<br />
Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
<br />
That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
<br />
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
<br />
And that I partly know the instrument
<br />
That screws me from my true place in your favour,
<br />
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
<br />
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
<br />
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
<br />
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
<br />
Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
<br />
Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
<br />
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
<br />
To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
<br />
To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OLIVIA</b>
Where goes Cesario?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
After him I love
<br />
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
<br />
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
<br />
If I do feign, you witnesses above
<br />
Punish my life for tainting of my love!

I have travell'd but two hours.

Good madam, hear me speak,
<br />
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
<br />
Taint the condition of this present hour,
<br />
Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
<br />
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
<br />
Set this device against Malvolio here,
<br />
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
<br />
We had conceived against him: Maria writ
<br />
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
<br />
In recompense whereof he hath married her.
<br />
How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
<br />
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
<br />
If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
<br />
That have on both sides pass'd.
<br />

Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
<br />
and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
<br />
one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
<br />
that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
<br />
But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
<br />
a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
<br />
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALVOLIO</b>
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.

He hath been most notoriously abused.

Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
<br />
He hath not told us of the captain yet:
<br />
When that is known and golden time convents,
<br />
A solemn combination shall be made
<br />
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
<br />
We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
<br />
For so you shall be, while you are a man;
<br />
But when in other habits you are seen,
<br />
Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.

When that I was and a little tiny boy,
<br />
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
<br />
A foolish thing was but a toy,
<br />
For the rain it raineth every day.
<br />
But when I came to man's estate,
<br />
With hey, ho, &amp;c.
<br />
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
<br />
For the rain, &amp;c.
<br />
But when I came, alas! to wive,
<br />
With hey, ho, &amp;c.
<br />
By swaggering could I never thrive,
<br />
For the rain, &amp;c.
<br />
But when I came unto my beds,
<br />
With hey, ho, &amp;c.
<br />
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
<br />
For the rain, &amp;c.
<br />
A great while ago the world begun,
<br />
With hey, ho, &amp;c.
<br />
But that's all one, our play is done,
<br />
And we'll strive to please you every day.
