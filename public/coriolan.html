                     You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?                <br />

                     First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">All</b>
                     We know't, we know't.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.                <br />
                     Is't a verdict?                <br />

          <p>

                     One word, good citizens.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.                <br />
                     What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they                <br />
                     would yield us but the superfluity, while it were                <br />
                     wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;                <br />
                     but they think we are too dear: the leanness that                <br />
                     afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an                <br />
                     inventory to particularise their abundance; our                <br />
                     sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with                <br />
                     our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I                <br />
                     speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
                     Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">All</b>
                     Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
                     Consider you what services he has done for his country?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     Very well; and could be content to give him good                <br />
                     report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
                     Nay, but speak not maliciously.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did                <br />
                     it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be                <br />
                     content to say it was for his country he did it to                <br />
                     please his mother and to be partly proud; which he                <br />
                     is, even till the altitude of his virtue.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
                     What he cannot help in his nature, you account a                <br />
                     vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;                <br />
                     he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">Shouts within</i><br />
                     What shouts are these? The other side o' the city                <br />
                     is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>

                     Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved                <br />

                     He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you                <br />
                     With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have                <br />
                     had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,                <br />
                     which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor                <br />
                     suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we                <br />
                     have strong arms too.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,                <br />
                     Will you undo yourselves?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     We cannot, sir, we are undone already.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     I tell you, friends, most charitable care                <br />
                     Have the patricians of you. For your wants,                <br />
                     Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well                <br />
                     Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them                <br />
                     Against the Roman state, whose course will on                <br />
                     The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs                <br />
                     Of more strong link asunder than can ever                <br />
                     Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,                <br />
                     The gods, not the patricians, make it, and                <br />
                     Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,                <br />
                     You are transported by calamity                <br />
                     Thither where more attends you, and you slander                <br />
                     The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,                <br />
                     When you curse them as enemies.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us                <br />
                     yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses                <br />
                     crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to                <br />
                     support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act                <br />
                     established against the rich, and provide more                <br />
                     piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain                <br />
                     the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and                <br />
                     there's all the love they bear us.                <br />

                     Either you must                <br />
                     Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,                <br />
                     Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you                <br />
                     A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;                <br />
                     But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture                <br />
                     To stale 't a little more.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to                <br />
                     fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please                <br />
                     you, deliver.                <br />

                     There was a time when all the body's members                <br />
                     Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:                <br />
                     That only like a gulf it did remain                <br />
                     I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,                <br />
                     Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing                <br />
                     Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments                <br />
                     Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,                <br />
                     And, mutually participate, did minister                <br />
                     Unto the appetite and affection common                <br />
                     Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     Well, sir, what answer made the belly?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,                <br />
                     Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--                <br />
                     For, look you, I may make the belly smile                <br />
                     As well as speak--it tauntingly replied                <br />
                     To the discontented members, the mutinous parts                <br />
                     That envied his receipt; even so most fitly                <br />
                     As you malign our senators for that                <br />
                     They are not such as you.                <br />

                     The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,                <br />
                     The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,                <br />
                     Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.                <br />
                     With other muniments and petty helps                <br />

                     I will tell you                <br />
                     If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--                <br />
                     Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.                <br />

                     Note me this, good friend;                <br />
                     Your most grave belly was deliberate,                <br />
                     Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:                <br />
                     'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,                <br />
                     'That I receive the general food at first,                <br />
                     Which you do live upon; and fit it is,                <br />
                     Because I am the store-house and the shop                <br />
                     Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,                <br />
                     I send it through the rivers of your blood,                <br />
                     Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;                <br />
                     And, through the cranks and offices of man,                <br />
                     The strongest nerves and small inferior veins                <br />
                     From me receive that natural competency                <br />
                     Whereby they live: and though that all at once,                <br />
                     You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--                <br />

                     Yet I can make my audit up, that all                <br />

                     But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:                <br />
                     Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;                <br />

                     Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,                <br />
                     That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,                <br />
                     Make yourselves scabs?                <br />

                     He that will give good words to thee will flatter                <br />
                     Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,                <br />
                     That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,                <br />
                     The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,                <br />
                     Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;                <br />
                     Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,                <br />
                     Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,                <br />
                     Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is                <br />
                     To make him worthy whose offence subdues him                <br />
                     And curse that justice did it.                <br />
                     Who deserves greatness                <br />
                     Deserves your hate; and your affections are                <br />
                     A sick man's appetite, who desires most that                <br />

                     Upon your favours swims with fins of lead                <br />
                     And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?                <br />

                     And call him noble that was now your hate,                <br />
                     Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,                <br />
                     That in these several places of the city                <br />
                     You cry against the noble senate, who,                <br />
                     Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else                <br />

                     Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's                <br />
                     grain enough!                <br />
                     Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,                <br />
                     And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry                <br />
                     With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high                <br />

                     For though abundantly they lack discretion,                <br />
                     Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,                <br />

                     That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,                <br />
                     That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not                <br />
                     Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds                <br />
                     They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,                <br />
                     And a petition granted them, a strange one--                <br />
                     To break the heart of generosity,                <br />
                     And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps                <br />
                     As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,                <br />

                     In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.                <br />
                     Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against                <br />
                     whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of                <br />
                     our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set                <br />
                     down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt                <br />
                     prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,                <br />
                     on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.                <br />

                     Not according to the prayer of the people, for they                <br />
                     love not Marcius.                <br />

                     In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two                <br />

                     This is strange now: do you two know how you are                <br />
                     censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of                <br />
                     occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:                <br />
                     give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at                <br />
                     your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a                <br />
                     pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for                <br />
                     being proud?                <br />

            <b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
                     We do it not alone, sir.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     I know you can do very little alone; for your helps                <br />
                     are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous                <br />
                     single: your abilities are too infant-like for                <br />
                     doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you                <br />
                     could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,                <br />
                     and make but an interior survey of your good selves!                <br />
                     O that you could!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,                <br />
                     proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as                <br />

                     I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that                <br />
                     loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying                <br />
                     Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in                <br />
                     favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like                <br />
                     upon too trivial motion; one that converses more                <br />
                     with the buttock of the night than with the forehead                <br />
                     of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my                <br />
                     malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as                <br />
                     you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink                <br />
                     you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a                <br />
                     crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have                <br />
                     delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in                <br />
                     compound with the major part of your syllables: and                <br />
                     though I must be content to bear with those that say                <br />
                     you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that                <br />
                     tell you you have good faces. If you see this in                <br />
                     the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known                <br />
                     well enough too? what barm can your bisson                <br />
                     conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be                <br />
                     known well enough too?                <br />

                     You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You                <br />
                     are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you                <br />
                     wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a                <br />
                     cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;                <br />
                     and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a                <br />
                     second day of audience. When you are hearing a                <br />
                     matter between party and party, if you chance to be                <br />
                     pinched with the colic, you make faces like                <br />
                     mummers; set up the bloody flag against all                <br />
                     patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,                <br />
                     dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled                <br />
                     by your hearing: all the peace you make in their                <br />
                     cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are                <br />
                     a pair of strange ones.                <br />

                     Come, come, you are well understood to be a                <br />

                     Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall                <br />
                     encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When                <br />
                     you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the                <br />
                     wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not                <br />
                     so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's                <br />

                     saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;                <br />
                     who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors                <br />

                     your worships: more of your conversation would                <br />
                     infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly                <br />

                     I heard him swear,                <br />
                     Were he to stand for consul, never would he                <br />
                     Appear i' the market-place nor on him put                <br />

                     That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and                <br />
                     loves not the common people.                <br />

                     Faith, there had been many great men that have                <br />
                     flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there                <br />
                     be many that they have loved, they know not                <br />
                     wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,                <br />
                     they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for                <br />
                     Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate                <br />
                     him manifests the true knowledge he has in their                <br />
                     disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets                <br />
                     them plainly see't.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Officer</b>
                     If he did not care whether he had their love or no,                <br />
                     he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither                <br />
                     good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater                <br />
                     devotion than can render it him; and leaves                <br />
                     nothing undone that may fully discover him their                <br />
                     opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and                <br />
                     displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he                <br />
                     dislikes, to flatter them for their love.                <br />

                     planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions                <br />
                     in their hearts, that for their tongues to be                <br />

                     When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.                <br />

                     I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus                <br />
                     Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held                <br />
                     That valour is the chiefest virtue, and                <br />
                     Most dignifies the haver: if it be,                <br />
                     The man I speak of cannot in the world                <br />
                     Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,                <br />
                     When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought                <br />
                     Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,                <br />
                     Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,                <br />
                     When with his Amazonian chin he drove                <br />
                     The bristled lips before him: be bestrid                <br />
                     An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view                <br />
                     Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,                <br />
                     And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,                <br />
                     When he might act the woman in the scene,                <br />
                     He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed                <br />
                     Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age                <br />
                     Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,                <br />
                     And in the brunt of seventeen battles since                <br />
                     He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,                <br />
                     Before and in Corioli, let me say,                <br />
                     I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;                <br />
                     And by his rare example made the coward                <br />
                     Turn terror into sport: as weeds before                <br />
                     A vessel under sail, so men obey'd                <br />
                     And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,                <br />
                     Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot                <br />
                     He was a thing of blood, whose every motion                <br />
                     Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd                <br />
                     The mortal gate of the city, which he painted                <br />
                     With shunless destiny; aidless came off,                <br />
                     And with a sudden reinforcement struck                <br />
                     Corioli like a planet: now all's his:                <br />
                     When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce                <br />
                     His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit                <br />
                     Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,                <br />
                     And to the battle came he; where he did                <br />
                     Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if                <br />
                     'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd                <br />
                     Both field and city ours, he never stood                <br />
                     To ease his breast with panting.                <br />

                     We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a                <br />
                     power that we have no power to do; for if he show us                <br />

                     our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
                     Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,                <br />
                     He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
                     Certainly                <br />
                     He flouted us downright.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Citizen</b>
                     No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Citizen</b>
                     Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says                <br />
                     He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us                <br />
                     His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SICINIUS</b>
                     Why, so he did, I am sure.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Citizens</b>
                     No, no; no man saw 'em.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Third Citizen</b>
                     He said he had wounds, which he could show                <br />
                     in private;                <br />
                     And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,                <br />
                     'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,                <br />
                     But by your voices, will not so permit me;                <br />
                     Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,                <br />
                     Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:                <br />
                     Your most sweet voices: now you have left                <br />
                     your voices,                <br />
                     I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SICINIUS</b>
                     Why either were you ignorant to see't,                <br />
                     Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness                <br />
                     To yield your voices?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
                     Could you not have told him                <br />
                     As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,                <br />
                     But was a petty servant to the state,                <br />
                     He was your enemy, ever spake against                <br />
                     Your liberties and the charters that you bear                <br />
                     I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving                <br />
                     A place of potency and sway o' the state,                <br />
                     If he should still malignantly remain                <br />
                     Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might                <br />
                     Be curses to yourselves? You should have said                <br />
                     That as his worthy deeds did claim no less                <br />
                     Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature                <br />
                     Would think upon you for your voices and                <br />
                     Translate his malice towards you into love,                <br />
                     Standing your friendly lord.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SICINIUS</b>
                     Thus to have said,                <br />
                     As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit                <br />
                     And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd                <br />
                     Either his gracious promise, which you might,                <br />
                     As cause had call'd you up, have held him to                <br />
                     Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,                <br />
                     Which easily endures not article                <br />
                     Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,                <br />
                     You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler                <br />
                     And pass'd him unelected.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
                     Did you perceive                <br />
                     He did solicit you in free contempt                <br />
                     When he did need your loves, and do you think                <br />
                     That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,                <br />
                     When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies                <br />
                     No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry                <br />

                     With what contempt he wore the humble weed,                <br />
                     How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,                <br />
                     Thinking upon his services, took from you                <br />

            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     Choler!                <br />
                     Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,                <br />
                     By Jove, 'twould be my mind!                <br />

                     It is a mind                <br />
                     That shall remain a poison where it is,                <br />
                     Not poison any further.                <br />

                     Shall remain!                <br />
                     Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you                <br />
                     His absolute 'shall'?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COMINIUS</b>
                     'Twas from the canon.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     'Shall'!                <br />
                     O good but most unwise patricians! why,                <br />
                     You grave but reckless senators, have you thus                <br />
                     Given Hydra here to choose an officer,                <br />
                     That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but                <br />
                     The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit                <br />
                     To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,                <br />
                     And make your channel his? If he have power                <br />
                     Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake                <br />
                     Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,                <br />
                     Be not as common fools; if you are not,                <br />
                     Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,                <br />
                     If they be senators: and they are no less,                <br />
                     When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste                <br />
                     Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,                <br />
                     And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'                <br />
                     His popular 'shall' against a graver bench                <br />
                     Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!                <br />
                     It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches                <br />
                     To know, when two authorities are up,                <br />
                     Neither supreme, how soon confusion                <br />
                     May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take                <br />
                     The one by the other.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth                <br />
                     The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used                <br />
                     Sometime in Greece,--                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Well, well, no more of that.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     Though there the people had more absolute power,                <br />
                     I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed                <br />
                     The ruin of the state.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
                     Why, shall the people give                <br />
                     One that speaks thus their voice?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     I'll give my reasons,                <br />
                     More worthier than their voices. They know the corn                <br />
                     Was not our recompense, resting well assured                <br />
                     That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,                <br />
                     Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,                <br />
                     They would not thread the gates. This kind of service                <br />
                     Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war                <br />
                     Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd                <br />
                     Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation                <br />
                     Which they have often made against the senate,                <br />
                     All cause unborn, could never be the motive                <br />
                     Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?                <br />
                     How shall this bisson multitude digest                <br />
                     The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express                <br />
                     What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;                <br />
                     We are the greater poll, and in true fear                <br />
                     They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase                <br />
                     The nature of our seats and make the rabble                <br />
                     Call our cares fears; which will in time                <br />
                     Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in                <br />
                     The crows to peck the eagles.                <br />

                     Seal what I end withal! This double worship,                <br />

                     Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,                <br />
                     Cannot conclude but by the yea and no                <br />
                     Of general ignorance,--it must omit                <br />
                     Real necessities, and give way the while                <br />
                     To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,                <br />
                     it follows,                <br />
                     Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--                <br />
                     You that will be less fearful than discreet,                <br />
                     That love the fundamental part of state                <br />
                     More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer                <br />
                     A noble life before a long, and wish                <br />
                     To jump a body with a dangerous physic                <br />
                     That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out                <br />
                     The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick                <br />
                     The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour                <br />
                     Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state                <br />
                     Of that integrity which should become't,                <br />
                     Not having the power to do the good it would,                <br />

                     The which shall turn you to no further harm                <br />

                     For we are peremptory to dispatch                <br />
                     This viperous traitor: to eject him hence                <br />
                     Were but one danger, and to keep him here                <br />
                     Our certain death: therefore it is decreed                <br />
                     He dies to-night.                <br />

                     Towards her deserved children is enroll'd                <br />

                     Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.                <br />
                     What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?                <br />
                     Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--                <br />
                     Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,                <br />
                     By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;                <br />
                     And what is left, to lose it by his country,                <br />
                     Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,                <br />
                     A brand to the end o' the world.                <br />

                     Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd                <br />
                     In bolted language; meal and bran together                <br />
                     He throws without distinction. Give me leave,                <br />
                     I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him                <br />

                     You must return and mend it.                <br />

                     There's no remedy;                <br />
                     Unless, by not so doing, our good city                <br />
                     Cleave in the midst, and perish.                <br />

                     I have a heart as little apt as yours,                <br />
                     But yet a brain that leads my use of anger                <br />

                     The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic                <br />
                     For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,                <br />

                     You are too absolute;                <br />
                     Though therein you can never be too noble,                <br />
                     But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,                <br />
                     Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,                <br />
                     I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,                <br />
                     In peace what each of them by the other lose,                <br />
                     That they combine not there.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</b>
                     If it be honour in your wars to seem                <br />
                     The same you are not, which, for your best ends,                <br />
                     You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,                <br />
                     That it shall hold companionship in peace                <br />
                     With honour, as in war, since that to both                <br />
                     It stands in like request?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     Why force you this?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</b>
                     Because that now it lies you on to speak                <br />
                     To the people; not by your own instruction,                <br />
                     Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,                <br />
                     But with such words that are but rooted in                <br />
                     Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables                <br />
                     Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.                <br />
                     Now, this no more dishonours you at all                <br />
                     Than to take in a town with gentle words,                <br />
                     Which else would put you to your fortune and                <br />
                     The hazard of much blood.                <br />
                     I would dissemble with my nature where                <br />
                     My fortunes and my friends at stake required                <br />
                     I should do so in honour: I am in this,                <br />
                     Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;                <br />
                     And you will rather show our general louts                <br />
                     How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,                <br />
                     For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard                <br />
                     Of what that want might ruin.                <br />

                     Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,                <br />
                     Not what is dangerous present, but the loss                <br />
                     Of what is past.                <br />

                     I prithee now, my son,                <br />
                     Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;                <br />
                     And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--                <br />
                     Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business                <br />
                     Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant                <br />
                     More learned than the ears--waving thy head,                <br />
                     Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,                <br />
                     Now humble as the ripest mulberry                <br />
                     That will not hold the handling: or say to them,                <br />
                     Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils                <br />
                     Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,                <br />
                     Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,                <br />
                     In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame                <br />
                     Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far                <br />
                     As thou hast power and person.                <br />

                     Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;                <br />
                     For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free                <br />
                     As words to little purpose.                <br />

                     their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can                <br />
                     tell you, and is almost mature for the violent                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</b>
                     My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done                <br />
                     To thee particularly and to all the Volsces                <br />
                     Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may                <br />
                     My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,                <br />
                     The extreme dangers and the drops of blood                <br />
                     Shed for my thankless country are requited                <br />
                     But with that surname; a good memory,                <br />
                     And witness of the malice and displeasure                <br />
                     Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;                <br />
                     The cruelty and envy of the people,                <br />
                     Permitted by our dastard nobles, who                <br />
                     Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;                <br />
                     And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be                <br />
                     Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity                <br />
                     Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--                <br />
                     Mistake me not--to save my life, for if                <br />
                     I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world                <br />
                     I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,                <br />
                     To be full quit of those my banishers,                <br />
                     Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast                <br />
                     A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge                <br />
                     Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims                <br />
                     Of shame seen through thy country, speed                <br />
                     thee straight,                <br />
                     And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it                <br />
                     That my revengeful services may prove                <br />
                     As benefits to thee, for I will fight                <br />
                     Against my canker'd country with the spleen                <br />
                     Of all the under fiends. But if so be                <br />
                     Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes                <br />
                     Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am                <br />
                     Longer to live most weary, and present                <br />
                     My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;                <br />
                     Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,                <br />
                     Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,                <br />
                     Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,                <br />
                     And cannot live but to thy shame, unless                <br />
                     It be to do thee service.                <br />

                     O Marcius, Marcius!                <br />
                     Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart                <br />
                     A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter                <br />
                     Should from yond cloud speak divine things,                <br />
                     And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more                <br />
                     Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine                <br />
                     Mine arms about that body, where against                <br />
                     My grained ash an hundred times hath broke                <br />
                     And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip                <br />
                     The anvil of my sword, and do contest                <br />
                     As hotly and as nobly with thy love                <br />
                     As ever in ambitious strength I did                <br />
                     Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,                <br />
                     I loved the maid I married; never man                <br />
                     Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,                <br />
                     Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart                <br />
                     Than when I first my wedded mistress saw                <br />
                     Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,                <br />
                     We have a power on foot; and I had purpose                <br />
                     Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,                <br />
                     Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out                <br />
                     Twelve several times, and I have nightly since                <br />
                     Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;                <br />
                     We have been down together in my sleep,                <br />
                     Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,                <br />
                     And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,                <br />
                     Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that                <br />
                     Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all                <br />
                     From twelve to seventy, and pouring war                <br />
                     Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,                <br />
                     Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,                <br />
                     And take our friendly senators by the hands;                <br />
                     Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,                <br />
                     Who am prepared against your territories,                <br />
                     Though not for Rome itself.                <br />

                     As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st                <br />
                     Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;                <br />
                     Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,                <br />
                     Or rudely visit them in parts remote,                <br />
                     To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:                <br />
                     Let me commend thee first to those that shall                <br />
                     Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!                <br />
                     And more a friend than e'er an enemy;                <br />
                     Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     Here's a strange alteration!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with                <br />
                     a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a                <br />
                     false report of him.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     What an arm he has! he turned me about with his                <br />
                     finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in                <br />
                     him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I                <br />
                     cannot tell how to term it.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,                <br />
                     but I thought there was more in him than I could think.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest                <br />
                     man i' the world.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.                <br />

                     Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,                <br />
                     Caius Marcius.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     Why do you say 'thwack our general '?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Third Servingman</b>
                     I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always                <br />
                     good enough for him.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too                <br />
                     hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth                <br />
                     on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched                <br />
                     him like a carbon ado.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     An he had been cannibally given, he might have                <br />
                     broiled and eaten him too.                <br />

                     Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son                <br />
                     and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no                <br />
                     question asked him by any of the senators, but they                <br />
                     stand bald before him: our general himself makes a                <br />
                     mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and                <br />
                     turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But                <br />
                     the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'                <br />
                     the middle and but one half of what he was                <br />
                     yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty                <br />
                     and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,                <br />
                     and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he                <br />
                     will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Third Servingman</b>
                     Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as                <br />
                     many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it                <br />
                     were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as                <br />
                     we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     Directitude! what's that?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Third Servingman</b>
                     But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,                <br />
                     and the man in blood, they will out of their                <br />
                     burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with                <br />
                     him.                <br />

                     drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a                <br />
                     parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they                <br />
                     wipe their lips.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.                <br />
                     This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase                <br />
                     tailors, and breed ballad-makers.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as                <br />
                     day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and                <br />
                     full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;                <br />
                     mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more                <br />
                     bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Servingman</b>
                     'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to                <br />
                     be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a                <br />
                     great maker of cuckolds.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Servingman</b>
                     Ay, and it makes men hate one another.                <br />

                     Reason; because they then less need one another.                <br />
                     The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap                <br />
                     as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.                <br />

                     It is spoke freely out of many mouths--                <br />
                     How probable I do not know--that Marcius,                <br />
                     Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,                <br />
                     And vows revenge as spacious as between                <br />

                     He and Aufidius can no more atone                <br />

          <p class="stagedir">Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant</p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</b>
                     Do they still fly to the Roman?                <br />

          <p>

                     I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but                <br />
                     Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,                <br />
                     Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;                <br />
                     And you are darken'd in this action, sir,                <br />
                     Even by your own.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</b>
                     I cannot help it now,                <br />
                     Unless, by using means, I lame the foot                <br />
                     Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,                <br />
                     Even to my person, than I thought he would                <br />
                     When first I did embrace him: yet his nature                <br />
                     In that's no changeling; and I must excuse                <br />
                     What cannot be amended.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lieutenant</b>
                     Yet I wish, sir,--                <br />
                     I mean for your particular,--you had not                <br />
                     Join'd in commission with him; but either                <br />
                     Had borne the action of yourself, or else                <br />
                     To him had left it solely.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</b>
                     I understand thee well; and be thou sure,                <br />
                     when he shall come to his account, he knows not                <br />
                     What I can urge against him. Although it seems,                <br />
                     And so he thinks, and is no less apparent                <br />
                     To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.                <br />
                     And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,                <br />
                     Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon                <br />
                     As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone                <br />
                     That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,                <br />
                     Whene'er we come to our account.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lieutenant</b>
                     Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</b>
                     All places yield to him ere he sits down;                <br />
                     And the nobility of Rome are his:                <br />
                     The senators and patricians love him too:                <br />
                     The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people                <br />
                     Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty                <br />
                     To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome                <br />
                     As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it                <br />
                     By sovereignty of nature. First he was                <br />
                     A noble servant to them; but he could not                <br />
                     Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,                <br />
                     Which out of daily fortune ever taints                <br />
                     The happy man; whether defect of judgment,                <br />
                     To fail in the disposing of those chances                <br />
                     Which he was lord of; or whether nature,                <br />
                     Not to be other than one thing, not moving                <br />
                     From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace                <br />
                     Even with the same austerity and garb                <br />
                     As he controll'd the war; but one of these--                <br />
                     As he hath spices of them all, not all,                <br />
                     For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,                <br />
                     So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,                <br />
                     To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues                <br />
                     Lie in the interpretation of the time:                <br />
                     And power, unto itself most commendable,                <br />
                     Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair                <br />
                     To extol what it hath done.                <br />
                     One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;                <br />
                     Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.                <br />
                     Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,                <br />
                     Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.                <br />

                     No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said                <br />
                     Which was sometime his general; who loved him                <br />
                     In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:                <br />
                     But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;                <br />
                     A mile before his tent fall down, and knee                <br />
                     The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd                <br />
                     To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COMINIUS</b>
                     He would not seem to know me.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">COMINIUS</b>
                     Yet one time he did call me by my name:                <br />
                     I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops                <br />
                     That we have bled together. Coriolanus                <br />
                     He would not answer to: forbad all names;                <br />
                     He was a kind of nothing, titleless,                <br />
                     Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire                <br />
                     Of burning Rome.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Why, so: you have made good work!                <br />
                     A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,                <br />
                     To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COMINIUS</b>
                     I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon                <br />
                     When it was less expected: he replied,                <br />
                     It was a bare petition of a state                <br />
                     To one whom they had punish'd.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Very well:                <br />
                     Could he say less?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COMINIUS</b>
                     I offer'd to awaken his regard                <br />
                     For's private friends: his answer to me was,                <br />
                     He could not stay to pick them in a pile                <br />
                     Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,                <br />
                     For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,                <br />
                     And still to nose the offence.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     For one poor grain or two!                <br />
                     I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,                <br />
                     And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:                <br />
                     You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt                <br />
                     Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SICINIUS</b>
                     Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid                <br />
                     In this so never-needed help, yet do not                <br />

                     Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,                <br />
                     More than the instant army we can make,                <br />
                     Might stop our countryman.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     Well, and say that Marcius                <br />
                     Return me, as Cominius is return'd,                <br />
                     Unheard; what then?                <br />
                     But as a discontented friend, grief-shot                <br />
                     With his unkindness? say't be so?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SICINIUS</b>
                     Yet your good will                <br />
                     must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure                <br />
                     As you intended well.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MENENIUS</b>
                     I'll undertake 't:                <br />
                     I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip                <br />
                     And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.                <br />
                     He was not taken well; he had not dined:                <br />
                     The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then                <br />
                     We pout upon the morning, are unapt                <br />
                     To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd                <br />
                     These and these conveyances of our blood                <br />
                     With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls                <br />
                     Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him                <br />

                     If you have heard your general talk of Rome,                <br />
                     And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,                <br />
                     My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.                <br />

                     The general is my lover: I have been                <br />
                     The book of his good acts, whence men have read                <br />
                     His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;                <br />
                     For I have ever verified my friends,                <br />
                     Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity                <br />
                     Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,                <br />
                     Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,                <br />
                     I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise                <br />
                     Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,                <br />
                     I must have leave to pass.                <br />

                     should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous                <br />
                     to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.                <br />

                     ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to                <br />
                     front his revenges with the easy groans of old                <br />
                     women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with                <br />
                     the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as                <br />
                     you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the                <br />
                     intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with                <br />
                     such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;                <br />
                     therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your                <br />
                     execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn                <br />

                     Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose                <br />
                     The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,                <br />
                     Our comfort in the country. We must find                <br />
                     An evident calamity, though we had                <br />
                     Our wish, which side should win: for either thou                <br />
                     Must, as a foreign recreant, be led                <br />
                     With manacles thorough our streets, or else                <br />
                     triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,                <br />
                     And bear the palm for having bravely shed                <br />
                     Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,                <br />
                     I purpose not to wait on fortune till                <br />
                     These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee                <br />
                     Rather to show a noble grace to both parts                <br />
                     Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner                <br />
                     March to assault thy country than to tread--                <br />
                     Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,                <br />
                     That brought thee to this world.                <br />

                     If it were so that our request did tend                <br />
                     To save the Romans, thereby to destroy                <br />
                     The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,                <br />
                     As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit                <br />
                     Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces                <br />
                     May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,                <br />
                     'This we received;' and each in either side                <br />
                     Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest                <br />
                     For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,                <br />
                     The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,                <br />
                     That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit                <br />
                     Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,                <br />
                     Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;                <br />
                     Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,                <br />
                     But with his last attempt he wiped it out;                <br />
                     Destroy'd his country, and his name remains                <br />
                     To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:                <br />
                     Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,                <br />
                     To imitate the graces of the gods;                <br />
                     To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,                <br />
                     And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt                <br />
                     That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?                <br />
                     Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man                <br />
                     Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:                <br />
                     He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:                <br />
                     Perhaps thy childishness will move him more                <br />
                     Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world                <br />
                     More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate                <br />
                     Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life                <br />
                     Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,                <br />
                     When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,                <br />
                     Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,                <br />
                     Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,                <br />
                     And spurn me back: but if it be not so,                <br />
                     Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,                <br />
                     That thou restrain'st from me the duty which                <br />
                     To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:                <br />
                     Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.                <br />
                     To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride                <br />
                     Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;                <br />
                     This is the last: so we will home to Rome,                <br />
                     And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:                <br />
                     This boy, that cannot tell what he would have                <br />
                     But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,                <br />
                     Does reason our petition with more strength                <br />
                     Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:                <br />
                     This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;                <br />
                     His wife is in Corioli and his child                <br />
                     Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:                <br />
                     I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,                <br />

                     yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown                <br />

                     now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness                <br />

                     his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity                <br />
                     and a heaven to throne in.                <br />

                     But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused                <br />

                     And grieve to hear't.                <br />
                     What faults he made before the last, I think                <br />
                     Might have found easy fines: but there to end                <br />
                     Where he was to begin and give away                <br />
                     The benefit of our levies, answering us                <br />
                     With our own charge, making a treaty where                <br />
                     There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.                <br />

                     Under your great command. You are to know                <br />
                     That prosperously I have attempted and                <br />
                     With bloody passage led your wars even to                <br />
                     The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home                <br />
                     Do more than counterpoise a full third part                <br />
                     The charges of the action. We have made peace                <br />
                     With no less honour to the Antiates                <br />
                     Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,                <br />
                     Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,                <br />
                     Together with the seal o' the senate, what                <br />
                     We have compounded on.                <br />

                     You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously                <br />
                     He has betray'd your business, and given up,                <br />
                     For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,                <br />
                     I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;                <br />
                     Breaking his oath and resolution like                <br />

                     Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears                <br />
                     He whined and roar'd away your victory,                <br />
                     That pages blush'd at him and men of heart                <br />
