                     So far forth as herself might be her chooser,

                     To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,

                     Her father hath commanded her to slip

                     Away with Slender and with him at Eton
                  
                <br />

                     Her mother, ever strong against that match

                     That he shall likewise shuffle her away,

                     While other sports are tasking of their minds,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She seemingly obedient likewise hath
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Her father means she shall be all in white,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To take her by the hand and bid her go,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The better to denote her to the doctor,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The maid hath given consent to go with him.
